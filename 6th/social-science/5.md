## Ancient Names in Literature

Ancient Indian texts do not just provide names but also describe the geography of the subcontinent.

### 1. Sapta Sindhava
The **Ṛig Veda**, India’s most ancient text (several thousand years old), refers to the northwest region as **'Sapta Sindhava'**, meaning the **'land of the seven rivers'**.
- The name is derived from **'Sindhu'**, which refers to the Indus River.

### 2. Bhāratavarṣha and Jambudvīpa
The **Mahābhārata** and later texts use terms that encompass the entire subcontinent:

- **Bhāratavarṣha:** Means "the country of the Bharatas." The *Bharatas* were a prominent Vedic group of people mentioned first in the Rig Veda.
- **Jambudvīpa:** Means "the island of the fruit of the jamun tree" (Indian Blackberry). Emperor Ashoka (c. 250 BCE) used this name in his inscriptions to describe his empire, which included modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and parts of Afghanistan.

### 3. The Definition in the Viṣhṇu Purāṇa
The *Viṣhṇu Purāṇa* provides a clear geographical definition of the land:

$$
\text{uttaram yat samudrasya himādreścaiva}
$$
$$
\text{dakṣiṇam varṣam tad bhāratam nāma ...}
$$

> "The country that lies north of the ocean and south of the snowy mountains is called Bhārata."

### Mapping Ancient Regions
The Mahābhārata mentions several regions that we recognize today:
- **Kāshmīra:** Kashmir
- **Kurukṣhetra:** Parts of Haryana
- **Prāgjyotiṣha:** Assam
- **Kaccha:** Kutch
- **Kerala:** Kerala

## The Influence of River Sindhu

Most foreign names for India are linguistic adaptations of the word **'Sindhu'** (the Indus River).

### 1. Persian Names (6th Century BCE)
The ancient Persians (from Iran) gained control of the Indus region. In their language:
- **Sindhu** became **Hind** or **Hidu/Hindu**.
- Note: In this context, 'Hindu' was a **geographical term**, not a religious one.

### 2. Greek Names
The ancient Greeks interacted with the Persians. Because the Greek language lacked the 'h' sound used by Persians, they dropped it:
- **Hindu** $\rightarrow$ **Indoi** or **Indike**.
- This eventually evolved into the Latin/English name **India**.

### 3. Chinese Names
Chinese travelers and scholars like **Xuanzang** (7th Century CE) used different terms:
- **Yintu** or **Yindu**: Derived from Sindhu.
- **Tianzhu**: Which can also mean "heavenly master," reflecting India's status as the land of the Buddha.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Hindustān:** This term was first used in a Persian inscription about 1,800 years ago and later became common among invaders to describe the subcontinent.

## The Indian Constitution

The identity of modern India is legally defined in its supreme law, the Constitution, which came into force in **1950**.

### Article 1
Right at the beginning, the Constitution addresses the dual names of the country:

<Callout variant="info">
**Article 1(1):** "India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States."
</Callout>

In the Hindi version of the Constitution, it is written as:
> **‘Bhārat arthāth India’**

### Why two names?
The inclusion of both names represents a bridge between:
1.  **Bharat:** Rooted in ancient history, Sanskrit literature, and cultural heritage.
2.  **India:** The name by which the country became known globally in modern times.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Definition - Constitution:** A document that spells out the basic principles and laws of a nation.
</Callout>

### Historical Context
As seen in the original manuscript of the Constitution (Fig. 5.5 in the text), the opening lines specify the territory and name of the Union, ensuring that the ancient legacy of *Bhārat* is preserved alongside the modern identity of *India*.

## Questions, Activities and Projects

### 1. Meaning of the Quotation
**Question:** Discuss what could be the meaning of the quotation at the start of the chapter?
> *"In India at a very early time the spiritual and cultural unity was made complete..."* — Sri Aurobindo

**Answer:** Sri Aurobindo suggests that India’s unity is not just political or administrative, but deeply **spiritual and cultural**. Long before modern borders were defined, the people living between the Himalayas and the seas shared a common way of life, values, and cultural surge that bound them together as one entity.

---

**c) In Aśhoka’s time, ‘Jambudvīpa’ included what is today India, parts of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.**

### 3. Creative Thinking
**Question:** If you were born some 2,000 years ago and had the chance to name our country, what name or names might you have chosen, and why?

**Answer:** *(Student's imagination)*
*Example:* "I might have named it **'Nadi-Matruka'** (Land Mothered by Rivers) because life in ancient times revolved entirely around the great river systems like the Sindhu, Ganga, and Sarasvati which provided water, transport, and fertile soil."

---

### 4. Motivations for Travel
**Question:** Why did people travel to India from various parts of the world in ancient times? What could be their motivations?

**Answer:** People traveled to India for several key reasons:
1.  **Trade:** India was famous for spices, textiles (muslin), and precious stones.
2.  **Education:** Famous universities like Nalanda and Taxila attracted scholars.
3.  **Religion/Spirituality:** Pilgrims (like Xuanzang) came to visit the land of the Buddha and collect sacred texts.
