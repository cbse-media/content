## Introduction

Mathematics is often called a game of patterns. In this chapter, we move beyond simple calculation to explore the *nature* of numbers. Why do some numbers behave the way they do? How can we predict if a number is divisible by 9 without dividing? What hidden rules govern the sum of consecutive numbers?

This chapter focuses on **Generalised Forms of Numbers**, **Tests of Divisibility**, and **Logic Puzzles** (Cryptarithms).

## Key Concepts

### 1. General Form of Numbers
Any number can be written in expanded form using place values.
For a 2-digit number $ab$:
$$ ab = 10a + b $$
For a 3-digit number $abc$:
$$ abc = 100a + 10b + c $$

### 2. Parity (Even and Odd)
*   **Addition Rules:**
    *   Even + Even = Even
    *   Odd + Odd = Even
    *   Even + Odd = Odd
*   **Multiplication Rules:**
    *   Even × Any Integer = Even
    *   Odd × Odd = Odd

### 3. Divisibility Summary

| Divisor | Rule | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2** | Ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 | $10k$ is always even. |
| **3** | Sum of digits is divisible by 3 | $10 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ |
| **4** | Last two digits divisible by 4 | $100$ is divisible by 4. |
| **5** | Ends in 0 or 5 | $10k$ is divisible by 5. |
| **6** | Divisible by 2 AND 3 | Factors of 6 are coprime. |
| **9** | Sum of digits is divisible by 9 | $10 \equiv 1 \pmod 9$ |
| **10** | Ends in 0 | Definition of base 10. |
| **11** | Difference of alternating digit sums is divisible by 11 | $10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}$ |

## Topics Covered
1.  **Patterns & Parity:** Sums of consecutive numbers and logic puzzles involving signs.
2.  **Divisibility Algebra:** Using letter-numbers to prove why divisibility shortcuts work.
3.  **Digital Roots:** Repeatedly adding digits to find the "root" of a number.
4.  **Cryptarithms:** Solving puzzles where digits are disguised as letters.

## Sums of Consecutive Numbers

Can every number be written as a sum of consecutive natural numbers? Let's verify.
*   $3 = 1 + 2$
*   $5 = 2 + 3$
*   $6 = 1 + 2 + 3$
*   $10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4$

<Callout variant="info">
**Power of 2 Exception:** Powers of 2 ($2, 4, 8, 16 \dots$) **cannot** be written as the sum of consecutive natural numbers.
</Callout>

### The 4-Number Sign Puzzle
Take any 4 consecutive numbers, say $3, 4, 5, 6$. Place `+` or `-` signs between them.
Example:
$$ 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 = 8 $$
$$ 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 = -12 $$

**Observation:** The result is always **EVEN**.

#### Algebraic Proof
Let the four numbers be $a, b, c, d$.
Consider the expression $S = a + b + c + d$.
If we change the sign of $b$ from $+$ to $-$, the new sum is $S' = a - b + c + d$.
The difference is $S - S' = 2b$.
Since $2b$ is always an even number, changing a sign changes the total sum by an even amount.
Therefore, if the initial sum is even (or odd), all variations will maintain the same **parity**.

For 4 consecutive integers (e.g., $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$):
Sum $= 4n + 6 = 2(2n + 3)$.
Since $2(2n+3)$ is a multiple of 2, the sum is always **even**. Thus, any variation of signs will also result in an even number.

## Pairs to Make Fours (Multiples of 4)

When do two even numbers sum to a multiple of 4?
Even numbers are of two types:
1.  **Multiples of 4 ($4k$):** $4, 8, 12 \dots$ (Remainder 0)
2.  **Not Multiples of 4 ($4k+2$):** $2, 6, 10 \dots$ (Remainder 2)

### Visualizing the Logic

    <text x="275" y="90" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">2 + 2 = 4 (New row of 4)</text>
  </svg>
</div>

**Conclusion:**
*   Sum of two multiples of 4 $\rightarrow$ **Multiple of 4**.
*   Sum of two non-multiples of 4 (even) $\rightarrow$ **Multiple of 4** (because $2+2=4$).

## The Logic of Place Value

Any number $N$ can be written using powers of 10.
Example: $4725 = 4(1000) + 7(100) + 2(10) + 5$.

To check divisibility, we replace $10$ with remainders.

## Divisibility by 9

**Key Fact:** $10 \div 9$ leaves a remainder of $1$.
Therefore, $100, 1000, 10^n$ all leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $9$.

**Proof:**
Consider a 3-digit number $abc = 100a + 10b + c$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
N &= 100a + 10b + c \\
&= (99 + 1)a + (9 + 1)b + c \\
&= (99a + 9b) + (a + b + c)
\end{aligned}
$$
The first part $(99a + 9b)$ is clearly divisible by 9.
Therefore, $N$ is divisible by 9 if and only if $(a + b + c)$ is divisible by 9.

<Callout variant="success">
**Rule:** A number is divisible by 9 if the **sum of its digits** is divisible by 9.
</Callout>

## Divisibility by 3

**Key Fact:** $10 \div 3$ leaves a remainder of $1$.
The logic is identical to 9.
$$
N = (99a + 9b) + (a + b + c)
$$
Since $(99a + 9b)$ is divisible by 3, $N$ depends entirely on the sum of digits $(a+b+c)$.

## Divisibility by 11

**Key Fact:** Powers of 10 alternate remainders when divided by 11.
*   $1 \equiv 1$
*   $10 = 11 - 1 \equiv -1$
*   $100 = 99 + 1 \equiv 1$
*   $1000 = 1001 - 1 \equiv -1$

**Proof:**
Consider $abcd = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
N &= 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\
&\equiv (-1)a + (1)b + (-1)c + d \pmod{11} \\
&\equiv (b + d) - (a + c) \pmod{11}
\end{aligned}
$$

<Callout variant="success">
**Rule:** A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of digits at odd places and the sum of digits at even places is 0 or a multiple of 11.
</Callout>

### Composite Rules
*   **Divisibility by 6:** Must be divisible by **2** AND **3**.
*   **Divisibility by 24:** Checking 4 and 6 is NOT enough (e.g., 12 is divisible by 4 and 6 but not 24). You must check **3** and **8** (since 3 and 8 are coprime).

## What is a Digital Root?

The **Digital Root** of a number is the single digit obtained by repeatedly adding the digits of the number until a single digit remains.

**Example:** Find the digital root of $489710$.
1.  Sum 1: $4 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 1 + 0 = 29$
2.  Sum 2: $2 + 9 = 11$
3.  Sum 3: $1 + 1 = 2$
**Digital Root = 2**

## Properties

1.  **Divisibility by 9:** If the Digital Root is 9, the number is divisible by 9.
2.  **Remainders:** The Digital Root is equivalent to the remainder when the number is divided by 9.
    *   *Exception:* If the remainder is 0, the Digital Root is 9.

### Pattern in Consecutive Numbers
Digital roots follow a repeating cycle: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, \dots$

<div class="flex justify-center my-6">
  <svg width="300" height="100" viewBox="0 0 300 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

    <text x="10" y="80" font-family="monospace" font-size="14" fill="currentColor">D.Root: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  1  2</text>
    <line x1="260" y1="60" x2="290" y2="60" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" marker-end="url(#arrow)" />
  </svg>
</div>

<Callout variant="tip">
**Math Trick:** When calculating Digital Roots, you can ignore any '9's or any digits that sum to 9 (e.g., 3 and 6). This is called "Casting out Nines".

## What are Cryptarithms?

Cryptarithms are puzzles where digits are replaced by letters.
**Rules:**
1.  Each letter represents a unique digit ($0-9$).
2.  The first digit of a number cannot be 0.
3.  Standard arithmetic rules apply.

## Example 1: Addition
$$
\begin{array}{c}
  \quad A \ 1 \\
+ \ 1 \ B \\
\hline
  \quad B \ 0
\end{array}
$$

**Solution:**
1.  **Units Column:** $1 + B$ ends in $0$.
    *   $1 + B = 10 \implies B = 9$.
    *   Carry over 1.
2.  **Tens Column:** $1 (\text{carry}) + A + 1 = B$.
    *   Since $B = 9$, $2 + A = 9 \implies A = 7$.
3.  **Check:** $71 + 19 = 90$. Correct.

## Example 2: Multiplication
$$
\begin{array}{c}
  \quad A \ B \\
\times \quad \quad 5 \\
\hline
  \quad C \ A \ B
\end{array}
$$

**Analysis:**
1.  **Units Digit:** $B \times 5$ ends in $B$.
    *   Possible values for $B$: $0$ or $5$.
2.  **If B = 0:** $A0 \times 5 = CA0$.
    *   $5 \times A$ ends in $A$. Possible $A$: $5$ (since $5 \times 5 = 25$).
    *   If $A=5, B=0$: $50 \times 5 = 250$.
    *   $C=2, A=5, B=0$. Fits the pattern $CAB$.
3.  **If B = 5:** $A5 \times 5 = CA5$.
    *   $5 \times 5 = 25$ (Carry 2).
    *   $(5 \times A) + 2$ ends in $A$.
    *   Try $A=2$: $(5 \times 2) + 2 = 12$. Ends in 2.
    *   If $A=2, B=5$: $25 \times 5 = 125$.
    *   $C=1, A=2, B=5$. Fits.

**Answer:** Two solutions exist ($50 \times 5 = 250$ or $25 \times 5 = 125$).

## Divisibility by 9 (Page 126)

**1. Check Divisibility by 9:**
*   (i) 123: Sum $1+2+3=6$ (No).
*   (ii) 405: Sum $4+0+5=9$ (Yes).
*   (iii) 8888: Sum 32 (No).
*   (iv) 93547: Sum 28 (No).
*   (v) 358095: Sum 30 (No).

**2. Smallest multiple of 9 with no odd digits.**
*   Digits must be even ($0, 2, 4, 6, 8$).
*   Sum must be 9? Impossible with only even numbers.
*   Sum must be 18.
*   Smallest number requires fewest digits, smallest leading digit.
*   Try 288: Sum 18. Even digits. **Answer: 288**.

**3. Multiple of 9 closest to 6000.**
*   $6000 \div 9$: Remainder is sum of digits $6$.
*   $6000 - 6 = 5994$. (Distance 6).
*   Next multiple: $5994 + 9 = 6003$. (Distance 3).
*   **Answer:** 6003.

**4. Multiples of 9 between 4300 and 4400.**
*   First multiple: Sum of $43xy$ needs to be 9 or 18.
*   $4+3=7$. Need 2 more. $4302$.
*   Last multiple: $4392$.
*   Sequence: $4302, 4311 \dots 4392$.
*   Count: $\frac{4392 - 4302}{9} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11$.

## Digital Roots (Page 131)

**1. Digital root of 8-digit number is 5.**
*   Add 10. $+10$ adds $1+0=1$ to the root.
*   New root = $5 + 1 = 6$.

**2. Sequence adding 11.**
*   Adding 11 is like adding 2 to the digital root (since $1+1=2$).
*   Sequence: $x, x+2, x+4 \dots$ (mod 9).

**3. Root of $9a + 36b + 13$.**
*   $9a$ and $36b$ are multiples of 9. Their digital root contribution is 9 (or 0).
*   Only 13 matters. Root of $13 = 1+3 = 4$.
*   **Answer:** 4.

**4. Conjectures:**
*   (i) Parity: A number and its digital root **do not** always share parity (e.g., 12 is even, root 3 is odd). But $N - \text{Root}(N)$ is always a multiple of 9.
*   (ii) Remainder: Digital root is the remainder mod 9.

**1. If 31z5 is a multiple of 9.**
Sum: $3+1+z+5 = 9+z$.
For divisibility by 9, $9+z$ must be 9 or 18.
$z=0$ or $z=9$. Both work.

**2. Snehal's Claim (Mod 12 and 8).**
*   Num 1: $12k + 8$.
*   Num 2: $12m - 4$.
*   Sum: $12(k+m) + 4$.
*   Is $12(k+m) + 4$ divisible by 8?
*   $12$ is divisible by 4, not 8.
*   Example: $k=0, m=1$. Sum = $8 + 8 = 16$ (Yes).
*   Example: $k=1, m=1$. Sum = $20 + 8 = 28$ (No, 28 is not div by 8).
*   **Conclusion:** False.

**3. Sum of two multiples of 3.**
Let $3a$ and $3b$. Sum $3(a+b)$.
*   If $(a+b)$ is even, sum is div by 6.
*   If $(a+b)$ is odd, sum is not div by 6.

**5. 48a23b is multiple of 18.**
*   Even (b must be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
*   Divisible by 9: $4+8+a+2+3+b = 17+a+b$.
*   $17+a+b$ must be 18 or 27.
*   $a+b = 1$ or $a+b = 10$.
*   Check pairs with even $b$:
    *   $b=0 \to a=1, a=10(X)$
    *   $b=2 \to a=-1(X), a=8$
    *   $b=4 \to a=6$
    *   $b=6 \to a=4$
    *   $b=8 \to a=2$
*   **Pairs (a,b):** $(1,0), (8,2), (6,4), (4,6), (2,8)$.

**6. 3p7q8 divisible by 44.**
*   Divisible by 4: Last two digits $q8$. $q$ must be even ($0, 2, 4, 6, 8$).
*   Divisible by 11: $(3+7+8) - (p+q) = 18 - (p+q)$ must be 0, 11, etc.
*   $p+q = 7$ or $p+q = 18$.
*   If $q$ is even:
    *   $q=0 \to p=7$.
    *   $q=2 \to p=5$.
    *   $q=4 \to p=3$.
    *   $q=6 \to p=1$.
    *   $q=8 \to p=-1$ (No) or $p+q=18 \to p=10$ (No).
*   **Solutions (p,q):** $(7,0), (5,2), (3,4), (1,6)$.

**15. Cryptarithms**
**(i) EF x E = GGG**
*   $GGG = 111 \times G = 37 \times 3 \times G$.
*   Since $E$ is a single digit, $EF$ is 2-digit.
*   Try $E=3$: $EF \times 3 = GGG$. $37 \times 3 = 111$.
*   Fits: $E=3, F=7, G=1$. ($37 \times 3 = 111$).

**(ii) WOW x 5 = MEOW**
*   $W \times 5$ ends in $W$. $W$ must be 0 or 5.
*   If $W=0$: $0O0$ (Invalid first digit).
*   So **W = 5**.
*   $5O5 \times 5 = MEO5$.
*   $5 \times 5 = 25$ (Carry 2).
*   $5 \times O + 2$ ends in $O$.
    *   $5O + 2 \equiv O \pmod{10}$.
    *   Only solution is odd $O$ where $5O$ ends in 5. $5+2=7$. No.
    *   Wait, $5 \times 2 = 10 \to 0$. $5 \times 7 = 35 \to 5$.
    *   Let's test digits:
    *   $O=2: 5 \times 2 + 2 = 12$ ($O=2$). Works.
    *   $O=7: 5 \times 7 + 2 = 37$ ($O=7$). Works.
*   **Case 1 (O=2):** $525 \times 5 = 2625$. $M=2, E=6, O=2, W=5$. (Matches O=2).
*   **Case 2 (O=7):** $575 \times 5 = 2875$. $M=2, E=8, O=7, W=5$. (Matches O=7).
*   Both are valid solutions.

## Example 1: Parity Logic
**Question:** If $n$ is an integer, prove that $n^2 + n$ is always even.

**Solution:**
We can factor the expression:
$$ n^2 + n = n(n+1) $$
This is the product of two consecutive integers.
In any pair of consecutive integers, one must be even and the other odd.
Since $\text{Even} \times \text{Odd} = \text{Even}$, the product is always even.

## Example 2: Finding Divisors
**Question:** Check if 12345 is divisible by 15.

**Solution:**
For divisibility by 15, the number must be divisible by both **3** and **5**.
1.  **Check 5:** The number ends in 5. **Yes.**
2.  **Check 3:** Sum of digits $= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$.
    Since 15 is divisible by 3, the number is divisible by 3. **Yes.**
**Conclusion:** 12345 is divisible by 15.

## Example 3: Cryptarithm Logic
**Question:** Find $A$ and $B$ if $2A \times A = 1B A$.

**Solution:**
1.  Units digit: $A \times A$ ends in $A$.
    Possible values for $A$: $0, 1, 5, 6$.
2.  Test values:
    *   $A=0$: $20 \times 0 = 0$ (Not 3 digits).
    *   $A=1$: $21 \times 1 = 21$ (Not 3 digits).
    *   $A=5$: $25 \times 5 = 125$. Here $B=2$. Fits $1BA$.
    *   $A=6$: $26 \times 6 = 156$. Here $B=5$. Fits $1BA$.
**Answer:** Two solutions: $25 \times 5 = 125$ or $26 \times 6 = 156$.

## Game Overview
**Navakankari**, also known as *Nine Men's Morris*, is a strategy game for two players. The goal is to form "mills" (lines of 3) to capture opponent pieces.

### Components
*   **Board:** Three concentric squares connected by lines at midpoints.
*   **Pieces:** 9 pawns per player (different colors).

### Rules

1.  **Placement Phase:**
    *   Players take turns placing one pawn on any empty intersection.
    *   If a player forms a **Mill** (3 in a row), they can remove one opponent's pawn (unless it is part of a mill).

2.  **Movement Phase:**
    *   Once all 9 pawns are placed, players take turns moving one pawn to an adjacent empty spot.
    *   Forming a new Mill allows removing an opponent's pawn.

3.  **Flying Phase (Optional):**
    *   When a player is reduced to 3 pawns, they may "fly" (move to *any* empty spot, not just adjacent).

### Winning Condition
*   Reduce the opponent to **2 pawns**.
*   OR Block the opponent so they cannot move.

### Strategy Tips
*   **Corners vs. Midpoints:** Midpoints offer movement in 4 directions (on the cross-lines), while corners only offer 2. Control the intersections!
*   **Double Mill:** Try to set up a formation where moving one piece back and forth closes a mill on every turn.
