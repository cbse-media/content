## 1. Local Economic Report
**Source:** Page 165
**Activity:** Analyzing local shops (Grocery, Salons, Repair shops).
**Key Insight:**
*   **Grocery:** Requires *Capital* (stock) and *Land* (storage).
*   **Mobile Repair:** Highly reliant on *Human Capital* (Skill/Knowledge).
*   **Funding:** Most small businesses start with personal savings or small loans (Capital).
*   **Motivation:** Often independence (being own boss) or necessity (livelihood).

## 2. Shivay's School Drop-out
**Source:** Page 170
**Scenario:** Shivay (Grade 8) dropped out because his father lost his job.
**Analysis:**
*   **Short Term:** Family saves money on school fees.
*   **Long Term:** Shivay loses **Human Capital** accumulation. Without education, his future earning potential decreases significantly. He may be trapped in low-skill, low-wage labour, perpetuating a cycle of poverty.

## 3. Importance of Jobs
**Source:** Page 170
**Question:** Are some jobs more important than others? What if cleaners or farmers stopped working?
**Insight:**
While society often pays differently based on skill, **all jobs are essential** for the ecosystem.
*   Without **Farmers**: No food (basic survival).
*   Without **Cleaners**: Disease spreads, affecting public health.
*   This highlights the dignity of labour; every role contributes to the economy.

## 4. J.R.D. Tata Analysis
**Source:** Page 175
**Questions:**
*   *Lessons:* Vision and ethics are as important as money.
*   *Knowledge:* Entrepreneurs don't know everything; they hire experts (Human Capital) but provide the vision.
*   *Motivation:* Profit is essential for survival, but **impact** (serving the nation/society) is often the drive for great entrepreneurs.

## 5. Decline of Indigenous Techniques
**Source:** Page 172
**Context:** Decline of stitched shipbuilding.
**Reasoning:**
*   **Technological Shift:** European ships used iron nails and stronger designs suited for heavy cannons and trans-oceanic voyages.
*   **Industrialization:** Mass production techniques eventually outpaced artisanal hand-stitching in speed and scale.
*   **Colonial Policy:** Often favoured British manufacturing over Indian traditional industries.

## 6. Supply Chain Disruption
**Source:** Page 179
**Context:** COVID-19 pandemic.
**Lesson:** Relying on a single source or far-off countries for raw materials is risky. When transport stopped, production halted. This teaches the importance of **Self-Reliance (Atmanirbhar)** or diversifying supply chains.
