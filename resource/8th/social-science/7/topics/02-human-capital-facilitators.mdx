## Developing Human Capital
Human capital is not static; it can be improved. The key facilitators are:

### 1. Education and Training
*   **Education:** Starts with basic literacy and extends to expertise. It enriches knowledge and problem-solving abilities.
*   **Training:** The process of learning specific skills for a job (e.g., a civil engineer visiting a construction site).
*   **Cognitive Development:** Learning, knowing, and understanding.

### 2. Healthcare
Good health is fundamental.
*   **Impact:** Healthy workers are physically and mentally sound, more creative, and absent less often.
*   **Result:** Higher productivity and efficiency.

### 3. Social and Cultural Influences
The work culture of a country influences its productivity.
*   **Japan (Kaizen):** Meaning "continuous improvement". Applied since the 1940s, leading to high living standards.
*   **Germany:** Known for a strong work ethic, punctuality, and attention to detail, making them leaders in technology.

## Challenges to Human Capital

### Literacy
*   **Adult Literacy Rate:** Percentage of people aged 15+ who can read and write a simple statement.
*   **India's Status (2023):** 85% for males, 70% for females (World Bank estimates).

### Demographic Dividend
India has a very young population. According to the Economic Survey 2024, **65% of Indians are below 35 years**.
*   **Definition:** The economic benefit a country gets when it has a large number of young, working-age people compared to dependents.
*   **Requirement:** To reap this benefit, the youth must have access to **quality education, health, and skilling**.

**Why is this important?**
When more people work and earn, and fewer depend on them, the nation creates a surplus that drives rapid economic growth.
