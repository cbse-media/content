## Environmental Responsibility
Production uses limited natural resources. If not managed well, it leads to:
*   **Pollution:** Leather factories in Tamil Nadu can pollute rivers if waste isn't treated.
*   **e-Waste:** Improper recycling of electronics releases lead and mercury.

**Sustainable Practices:**
Producers must adopt practices to replenish resources, such as recycling water and using recycled materials as inputs.

## Social Responsibility
Businesses have a duty towards their workers:
1.  **Fair Compensation:** Proper wages.
2.  **Safety:** Safe working environments.
3.  **Rights:** No discrimination, paid leave, and healthcare.

## Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
CSR refers to businesses addressing social and environmental concerns to benefit society.
