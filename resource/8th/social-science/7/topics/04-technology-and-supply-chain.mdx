## Technology: An Enabler
Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to practical purposes. It does not always mean modern electronics; a simple pulley is also technology.
*   **Role:** Helps produce more goods with fewer inputs.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **UPI:** Instant payments.
    *   **GPS:** Efficient transport routes.
    *   **Drones:** Spraying fertilizers on farms.
    *   **Online Learning:** Platforms like **SWAYAM** and **National Career Service** bridge the gap between skills and jobs.

## Interconnectedness of Factors
The four factors (Land, Labour, Capital, Entrepreneurship) must work together.
*   **Labour-Intensive:** Agriculture, handicrafts (rely more on people).
*   **Capital-Intensive:** Satellites, semiconductors (rely more on machines).

### The Supply Chain
A supply chain is the network of individuals, organizations, resources, and technology involved in creating and selling a product. Global events (like COVID-19) can disrupt these chains if we rely too much on far-off sources.

### Case Study: Mobile Phone Assembly
India is the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. The process involves complex coordination.
