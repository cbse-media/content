## 1. Land (Natural Resources)
In economics, 'Land' is not just the ground we stand on. It encompasses all **natural resources** gifted by nature.
*   **Scope:** Includes geographical land, soil, forests, water, air, sunlight, minerals, oil, and natural gas.
*   **Usage:** Businesses either purchase land or pay **rent** to use it.
*   **Example:** A factory needs ground to be built on, water for cooling machines, and electricity (often generated from coal or gas).

## 2. Labour (Human Resources)
Labour refers to the **physical and mental effort** used in production. Everyone contributes differently based on their role.
*   **Examples:** Carpenters, farmers, teachers, doctors.
*   **Requirement:** Varying levels of physical strength, knowledge, and skill.

### People as a Resource vs. Human Capital
While **Labour** refers to the effort, **Human Capital** refers to the *quality* of that effort.

*   **Human Capital:** The specialized skills, knowledge, abilities, and expertise required to perform labour efficiently.
*   **Skill:** The ability to do an activity or job well with practice and training.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Key Distinction**
*   **Labour:** Physical/Mental work done (e.g., hours spent building a wall).
*   **Human Capital:** The skill set that makes the work better/faster (e.g., knowledge of engineering principles to build a stronger wall).

### India's Ancient Skill Heritage
India has a rich legacy of skill-based knowledge.
*   **Work as Worship:** Tools were worshipped (*Vishwakarma puja* / *Ayudha puja*). Products were a blend of *kala* (art) and *vidya* (knowledge).
*   **Shilpa Shastras:** Ancient texts containing detailed design guidelines for sculptures, buildings, and paintings.
*   **Stitched Shipbuilding:** A 2000-year-old technique where wooden planks were stitched with cords instead of nails. This made ships flexible and durable for navigating the Indian Ocean.

**Decline of Indigenous Techniques**
Many traditional techniques, like stitched shipbuilding, declined after the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century but are still used for small fishing boats today.
