## Mighty Maratha Women

### Maharani Tarabai
*   **Role:** Led the Maratha resistance after her husband Rajaram's death.
*   **Strategy:** She realized North India was empty of Mughal troops (since Aurangzeb was in the Deccan). She sent Maratha armies north to raid Mughal lands, turning the tide of the war.

### Ahilyabai Holkar (1725–1795)
*   **Ruler of Indore:** Governed for 30 years after losing her husband and son.
*   **Administration:** Known for justice, stability, and promoting the weaving industry (Maheshwari sarees).
*   **Builder:** She rebuilt temples across India that had been destroyed, including **Kashi Vishwanath (Varanasi)** and **Somnath (Gujarat)**. She built ghats, wells, and rest houses from the Himalayas to Rameswaram.

## Cultural Revival

### Language and Identity
*   **Rajya-Vyavahara-Kosha:** Shivaji commissioned this dictionary to replace Persian administrative terms with Sanskrit/Marathi equivalents.
*   **Seal:** His royal seal was in Sanskrit, asserting a native Hindu identity.

### Thanjavur Marathas (Tamil Nadu)
The branch of Marathas ruling Thanjavur fostered a brilliant syncretic culture.
*   **Serfoji II:**
    *   A scholar-king interested in Medicine (established *Dhanvantari Mahal*).
    *   Patronized Western and Indian medicine.
    *   Installed the first printing press by a native ruler.
    *   **Arts:** Contributed to the development of **Carnatic Music** and **Bharatanatyam**.
