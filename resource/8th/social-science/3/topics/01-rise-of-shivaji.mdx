## Who Are the Marathas?
The Marathas are a Marathi-speaking warrior group native to the Deccan plateau (present-day Maharashtra). Before their political rise, a strong cultural foundation was laid by **Bhakti Saints** like Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Tukaram, and Ramdas, who promoted social unity and devotion.

## The Rise of Shivaji (Born 1630)
Born to **Shahji Bhonsle** and **Jijabai**, Shivaji grew up in Pune. While his father served the Deccan Sultanates, Shivaji envisioned a sovereign kingdom (*Swarājya*).
*   **At age 16:** He began capturing neglected forts in the Pune region, challenging the established Sultanates.

### Conflict with Bijapur: Afzal Khan (1659)
To crush Shivaji, the Bijapur Sultanate sent their veteran general, **Afzal Khan**.
*   **Strategy:** Shivaji engaged in psychological warfare and agreed to a private meeting at the foot of **Pratapgad Fort**.
*   **The Encounter:** Anticipating treachery, Shivaji wore armor under his clothes and concealed a **Wāgh nakh** (tiger-claw weapon). When Afzal Khan attacked, Shivaji killed him.
*   **Result:** The Maratha army, hidden in the dense forests, routed the leaderless Bijapur forces using guerrilla tactics.

### Conflict with the Mughals
Shivaji's growing power alarmed the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

#### 1. Shaista Khan and the "Surgical Strike"
*   Mughal noble Shaista Khan occupied Pune.
*   **The Raid:** Shivaji infiltrated the camp at night with a small band of soldiers, entering the Lal Mahal. Shaista Khan barely escaped, losing his fingers. This daring raid forced the Mughals to retreat.

#### 2. The Sack of Surat
*   Surat was a wealthy Mughal trading port. Shivaji sacked it twice to obtain funds for his army, challenging Mughal prestige.

#### 3. Treaty of Purandar & Agra Escape
*   Aurangzeb sent **Jai Singh** (a Rajput general) to defeat Shivaji.
*   **Treaty:** Shivaji was forced to sign the Treaty of Purandar, surrendering many forts.
*   **Agra Visit (1666):** Shivaji visited Aurangzeb’s court but was insulted and placed under house arrest.
*   **The Great Escape:** Shivaji famously escaped by hiding in baskets of sweets meant for distribution to holy men.

### Coronation (1674)
Shivaji was crowned **Chhatrapati** (Sovereign King) at **Raigad Fort** in 1674.
*   He adopted the title *Kshatriya Kulavantas*.
*   Started a new era: *Rājyābhiṣheka shaka*.
*   **Dakshin Digvijaya:** He later expanded his kingdom into South India (Tamil Nadu/Karnataka), creating a strategic depth against Mughals.
