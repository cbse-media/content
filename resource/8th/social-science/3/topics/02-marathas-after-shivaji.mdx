## The War of Independence (1680–1707)
After Shivaji’s death in 1680, the Marathas faced the full might of Aurangzeb.
1.  **Chhatrapati Sambhaji:** Fought bravely but was captured, tortured, and executed by Aurangzeb.
2.  **Chhatrapati Rajaram:** Fled to **Gingee** (Tamil Nadu) to continue the fight from the south.
3.  **Maharani Tarabai:** After Rajaram's death, his widow Tarabai led the resistance. She organized counter-invasions into Mughal territory (Malwa/Gujarat).

**Result:** Aurangzeb spent 25 years in the Deccan trying to crush the Marathas but failed. He died in 1707, leaving a bankrupt and fractured Mughal empire.

## The Era of the Peshwas
Under Chhatrapati Shahu (Sambhaji's son), the administrative power shifted to the **Peshwas** (Prime Ministers), based in Pune.
*   **Key Peshwas:** Balaji Vishwanath, **Bajirao I**, and Nanasaheb.
*   **Structure:** The empire became a confederacy. Regional chiefs (Gaekwads, Holkars, Scindias, Bhonsles) ruled semi-autonomously but acknowledged the Peshwa's authority.

### Pan-Indian Expansion
*   **North:** Controlled Delhi, Lahore, and Peshawar (modern Pakistan).
*   **East/South:** Expanded into Odisha, Bengal, and Karnataka.
*   **Role:** They became the protectors of the Mughal throne, often dictating politics in Delhi.

### The Third Battle of Panipat (1761)
*   **Conflict:** Marathas vs. **Ahmad Shah Abdali** (Afghan ruler).
*   **Outcome:** A disastrous defeat for the Marathas. A generation of leaders was lost.
*   **Recovery:** Under Peshwa Madhavrao and generals like **Mahadji Shinde**, the Marathas quickly recovered and recaptured Delhi in 1771.

### The End of Maratha Power
The British identified the Marathas as their main rivals.
*   **Anglo-Maratha Wars:** Three wars were fought between 1775 and 1818.
*   **Causes of Defeat:** Internal disunity among Maratha chiefs and superior British organization/technology.
*   **1818:** The Peshwa rule ended, and the British took control of India.
