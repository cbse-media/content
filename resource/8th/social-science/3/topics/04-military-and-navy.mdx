## Forts: The Core of the State
Forts (*Killa*) were the backbone of Maratha power.
*   **Ramachandrapant Amatya** wrote: *"This kingdom was created by the late great master from forts alone."*
*   **Strategy:** Forts provided shelter during invasions, storage for supplies, and control over trade routes.
*   **Famous Forts:** Raigad (Capital), Pratapgad, Sindhudurg (Sea Fort), Gingee.

## Army Structure
The army consisted of Infantry and Cavalry.
1.  **Bargirs:** Soldiers whose horses and weapons were provided by the State.
2.  **Shiledars:** Freelance soldiers who brought their own horses and equipment.

### Guerrilla Warfare (*Ganimi Kava*)
*   **Concept:** Using small, mobile units to ambush large, slow-moving armies.
*   **Tactics:** Surprise attacks, cutting off supply lines, and retreating into difficult terrain (hills/forests) where enemy cavalry could not follow.

## Maritime Supremacy (The Navy)
Shivaji realized that "He who has the Navy, owns the Sea." He was one of the few Indian rulers to build a dedicated navy to counter the Portuguese, British, and Siddis.

*   **Key Admiral:** **Kanhoji Angre** (18th Century).
    *   Labeled a "pirate" by frustrated Europeans.
    *   He effectively controlled the Konkan coast, forcing Europeans to buy permits (*Cartaz*) to trade, reversing the practice where Europeans forced Indians to buy passes.
*   **Ships:** Built small, maneuverable ships (Gurabs, Gallivats) suited for the shallow creeks of the Konkan coast, which could outmaneuver heavy European vessels.
