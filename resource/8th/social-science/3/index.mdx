## Introduction

The rise of the Marathas in the 17th century was a defining moment in Indian history. Native to the rugged Deccan plateau, the Marathas, united by a common language (Marathi) and the Bhakti tradition, rose to challenge the Mughal Empire and eventually became the primary power in India before the British conquest.

This chapter traces the journey from the establishment of **Swarājya** (self-rule) by **Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj** to the empire's expansion under the Peshwas and valiant queens like **Tarabai** and **Ahilyabai Holkar**.
