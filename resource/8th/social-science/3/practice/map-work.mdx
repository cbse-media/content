## Map Analysis

### Fig 3.9: Shivaji's Kingdom (1680)
*   **Core:** A narrow strip along the Sahyadris and Konkan coast (Pune, Raigad, Satara).
*   **South:** Detached territories in Tamil Nadu (Gingee, Thanjavur) and Karnataka.
*   **Strategy:** This "Southern Extension" was deliberate. When Aurangzeb captured the core Maharashtra forts later, the Maratha leadership shifted to Gingee in the south, stretching Mughal supply lines until they broke.

### Fig 3.11: Maratha Empire (1759)
*   **Extent:** From the Indus river (Attock/Peshawar) in the North to the Tungabhadra in the South. From Gujarat in the West to Odisha in the East.
*   **Color Coding:**
    *   **Orange:** Direct Maratha rule or Tributary states.
    *   **Green (Nizam):** Confined to Hyderabad.
    *   **Yellow (Mysore):** Confined to the south.
*   **Significance:** This map proves the Marathas were the true pan-Indian successors to the Mughals. The British had to conquer *this* map, not the Mughal map, to rule India.
