## Questions and Activities

### 1. Analyse how geography (particularly mountains and coastlines) guided Maratha military strategy and state formation.

**Answer:**
Geography was the greatest ally of the Marathas.
*   **Mountains (Sahyadris):** The steep hills and dense forests were perfect for **Guerrilla Warfare**. Shivaji built forts on high peaks (like Raigad and Pratapgad) which were difficult for heavy Mughal artillery and cavalry to access. They served as watchtowers and safe havens.
*   **Coastline (Konkan):** Shivaji realized the threat posed by European powers arriving by sea. The long Konkan coastline necessitated a **Navy**. He built sea forts like **Sindhudurg** to protect trade and check the influence of the Siddi and Portuguese naval powers.

### 2. Imagine you are creating a short biography of a Maratha leader. Choose one (e.g., Ahilyabai Holkar).

**Answer: Ahilyabai Holkar**
Ahilyabai Holkar (1725–1795) was the noble queen of the Malwa kingdom (Indore). Thrust into power after the death of her husband and father-in-law, she ruled for three decades with wisdom and compassion.
*   **Challenge Overcome:** In an era dominated by men, she not only held onto power but also maintained peace and stability while the rest of India was in chaos. She personally led armies into battle when necessary.
*   **Inspiration:** She is best known for her piety and infrastructure work. She rebuilt the Kashi Vishwanath temple (destroyed by Aurangzeb) and established the Maheshwar weaving industry, providing livelihoods to her people. She represents the ideal of a benevolent ruler (*Lokmata*).

### 3. If you could visit one Maratha fort today, which would you choose and why?

**Answer:**
I would choose **Raigad Fort**.
*   **Strategic Importance:** It was the capital of the Maratha Empire chosen by Shivaji himself. It is situated on a steep hill, making it almost impregnable.
*   **History:** This is where Shivaji’s **Coronation (Rajyabhishek)** took place in 1674, marking the formal birth of the Maratha Empire.
*   **Architecture:** It has the *Maha Darwaja*, the marketplace (*Holicha Mal*), and the ruins of the royal palace, offering a glimpse into the grandeur of Swarajya.

### 4. "The British took India from the Marathas more than from the Mughals." Explain.

**Answer:**
By the mid-18th century, the Mughal Empire had declined and was confined to Delhi. The **Marathas** controlled vast territories across North, Central, and South India (including Delhi, Lahore, and Cuttack). They were the *de facto* protectors of the Mughal throne.
*   **Evidence:** The British had to fight **three major Anglo-Maratha wars** (1775–1818) to establish supremacy. Defeating the Marathas was the final hurdle for the British East India Company to become the masters of India.

### 5. Compare how Shivaji and later Marathas treated religious places and people of different faiths.

**Answer:**
*   **Shivaji:** He was a devout Hindu but secular in statecraft. He respected Muslim saints, forbade the destruction of mosques, and treated women of captured enemy camps with honor. His navy and army had many Muslim commanders (e.g., Daulat Khan).
*   **Thanjavur Marathas:** They built a syncretic culture. Serfoji II patronized arts and sciences irrespective of religion, including Western medicine and Christian missionaries (Schwartz).
*   **Later Period:** While generally tolerant, occasional excesses occurred during expansion (e.g., raids in Bengal), but these were political/economic rather than religiously motivated.

### 6. Why were forts 'the core of the state' for Marathas?

**Answer:**
As stated by Ramachandrapant Amatya in *Adnyapatra*:
1.  **Defense:** In the absence of forts, land gets devastated by invasion. Forts allowed the army to hold out against much larger forces (like Aurangzeb's).
2.  **Control:** They dominated trade routes and mountain passes.
3.  **Survival:** During the 27-year war with Aurangzeb, the Marathas survived by moving from one fort to another, preventing the Mughals from ever capturing the leadership decisively.

### 7. Design a Maratha Coin.

**Answer:**
*   **Front:** Image of a **Fort** (symbolizing strength) and a **Ship** (symbolizing naval power).
*   **Back:** Inscription in **Devanagari** (asserting linguistic identity) and a **Wheat Sheaf** (symbolizing agricultural prosperity).
*   **Metal:** Copper or Gold, following the *Shivrai* and *Hon* denominations used by Shivaji.

### 8. What was the Marathas' most important contribution to Indian history?

**Answer:**
The most important contribution was the **revival of indigenous sovereignty (Swarajya)**. At a time when India was dominated by foreign powers (Mughals, Europeans), the Marathas demonstrated that Indians could build a powerful, sophisticated empire, administer it efficiently (Ashta Pradhan), and defend it. They broke the myth of Mughal invincibility and preserved Indian culture, temples, and traditions during a critical transitional century.
