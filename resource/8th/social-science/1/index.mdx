## Introduction

Natural resources are the foundation of all life and economic activity on Earth. From the air we breathe to the metals used in our smartphones, everything originates from Nature. This chapter explores how we define resources, how we categorize them, and the critical balance required to sustain them for future generations.

We must move towards a **regenerative economy**—one that operates in harmony with nature, minimizing waste and replenishing what is used.

**Quote to Ponder:**
"We must return to the innate wisdom of nature herself, the ultimate regenerator and recycler of all resources."

### The Big Questions
This chapter helps us answer three fundamental questions:
1. **How do we categorise natural resources?** (By use, renewability, etc.)
2. **What is the connection between the distribution of natural resources and different aspects of life?** (Economy, conflict, trade).
3. **What are the implications of unsustainable use or over-exploitation?** (Climate change, resource depletion, pollution).

### Chapter Roadmap

| Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Meaning & Criteria** | When does nature become a "resource"? |
| **Categories** | Essential for life, Materials, and Energy sources. |
| **Renewability** | Understanding restoration, regeneration, and the limits of renewable resources. |
| **Distribution** | The "Resource Curse", geopolitical conflicts, and uneven distribution. |
| **Stewardship** | Case studies from Punjab (Groundwater) to Sikkim (Organic Farming). |

### Key Formula for Resource Validity

For an element of nature to be considered a resource, it must pass three filters:

$$
\text{Resource} = \text{Technologically Accessible} + \text{Economically Feasible} + \text{Culturally Acceptable}
$$
