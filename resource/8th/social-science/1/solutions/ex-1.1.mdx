## Questions and Activities

### 1. What can make what is today a renewable resource non-renewable tomorrow? Describe some actions that can prevent this from happening.

**Answer:**
A renewable resource can become effectively non-renewable if the **rate of extraction exceeds the rate of regeneration**. Nature requires a specific time to heal and replenish. If we disturb this rhythm, the resource stock depletes faster than it can grow back.

*   **Example:** Groundwater is renewable via rain, but in Punjab, it is extracted faster than rain can replenish it, leading to dried-up aquifers. Similarly, forests are renewable, but rapid deforestation turns them into barren land.
*   **Preventive Actions:**
    1.  **Sustainable Harvest:** Following regulations (e.g., fishing bans during spawning seasons).
    2.  **Afforestation:** Planting more trees than are cut.
    3.  **Water Harvesting:** Capturing rainwater to recharge aquifers.
    4.  **Circular Economy:** Recycling and reusing materials to reduce demand on fresh resources.

### 2. Name five ecosystem functions that serve humans.

**Answer:**
Ecosystem functions become "services" when they benefit humans. Five key functions include:
1.  **Production of Oxygen:** Trees and plants produce oxygen essential for human life.
2.  **Water Filtration:** Forests and soil naturally filter pollutants from water, providing clean groundwater.
3.  **Soil Formation & Nutrient Cycling:** Decomposition of organic matter enriches soil for agriculture.
4.  **Pollination:** Insects and birds pollinate crops, ensuring food production.
5.  **Climate Regulation:** Forests absorb carbon dioxide and regulate local temperatures and rainfall patterns.

### 3. What are renewable resources? How are they different from non-renewable ones? What can people do to ensure that renewable resources continue to be available for our use and that of future generations? Give two examples.

**Answer:**
*   **Definition:** Renewable resources are those that can be replenished or reproduced by physical, chemical, or mechanical processes within a human timeframe (e.g., solar energy, wind, forests).
*   **Difference:**
    *   *Renewable:* Unlimited or regenerates quickly (Sun, Wind).
    *   *Non-Renewable:* Finite and takes millions of years to form (Coal, Petroleum).
*   **Ensuring Availability (Stewardship):**
    We must respect the **cycle of regeneration**.
    *   *Example 1 (Water):* Use drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting to prevent groundwater depletion.
    *   *Example 2 (Soil):* Use organic fertilizers (compost) and crop rotation instead of chemicals to maintain soil health (as seen in Sikkim).

### 4. Identify cultural practices in your home and neighbourhood that point to mindfulness in the use of natural resources.

**Answer:**
*(Note: Students can answer this based on personal observation, but here are standard examples based on the text)*
1.  **Sacred Groves:** Treating patches of forests as sacred prevents tree cutting.
2.  **River Worship:** Practices like offering *Arghyam* to the Sun or worshipping rivers (Ganga, Kaveri) traditionally promoted keeping water bodies clean (though modern pollution challenges this).
3.  **Reuse/Recycling:** Traditional Indian households often reuse containers, clothes, and water (e.g., using water from washing vegetables for plants).
4.  **Food Habits:** Eating seasonal and local produce reduces the carbon footprint associated with transport and storage.

### 5. What are some considerations to keep in mind in the production of goods for our current use?

**Answer:**
When producing goods, we must consider:
1.  **Source Sustainability:** Are raw materials being sourced without permanently damaging the ecosystem?
2.  **Pollution Control:** Does the manufacturing process release harmful waste? (e.g., Cement dust or chemical effluents).
3.  **Waste Management:** Can the final product be recycled or is it biodegradable?
4.  **Social Impact:** Does the production displace local communities or exploit labor?
5.  **Efficiency:** Maximizing output while minimizing energy and raw material input.
