## In-Text Activity Solutions

### 1. Identifying Human Interventions (Page 7)
**Prompt:** Identify human actions in your surroundings that result in Nature losing her ability to restore and regenerate. What interventions can restore Nature’s cycle?

**Analysis:**
*   **Harmful Actions:**
    *   **Concretization:** Covering soil with concrete prevents rainwater from seeping in, stopping groundwater recharge.
    *   **Plastic Waste:** Dumping plastic in rivers chokes aquatic life and prevents natural water purification.
    *   **Stubble Burning:** Destroys soil nutrients and kills friendly bacteria necessary for soil regeneration.
*   **Restorative Interventions:**
    *   **Desilting ponds:** Allows better water storage.
    *   **Planting native trees:** Restores local biodiversity.
    *   **Composting:** Returns organic nutrients to the soil.

### 2. Renewable Resources in Your Region (Page 8)
**Prompt:** Assess the types of renewable resources in your region. What has been the change in their status?

**Guidance for Students:**
*   *If you live in a City:* Look at **Air Quality**. Has it worsened due to vehicles? Look at **Groundwater**. Are borewells digging deeper every year?
*   *If you live in a Village:* Look at **Forest cover**. Has it reduced? Are **ponds** seasonal now instead of perennial?
*   *Report Focus:* Link the decline to population pressure and lack of conservation efforts.

### 3. Daily Use of Non-Renewables (Page 8)
**Prompt:** What non-renewable resources do you use daily? What are possible renewable substitutes?

| Daily Item | Non-Renewable Source | Renewable Substitute |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electricity** | Coal (Thermal Power) | Solar Panels (Rooftop), Wind Energy |
| **Car/Bike Fuel** | Petroleum/Diesel | Electric Vehicles (charged via Solar), Bio-fuels |
| **Plastics** | Crude Oil | Bamboo, Jute, Starch-based bio-plastics |
| **Gold/Jewelry** | Mined Gold Ore | Recycled Gold, Lab-grown alternatives |

### 4. Mineral Distribution Map Analysis (Page 9)
**Prompt:** Observe the map in Fig 1.11. Notice uneven distribution.

**Observation:**
*   **Central/Eastern India (Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh):** Rich in **Coal** and **Iron Ore**. This is why major steel plants (Bokaro, Jamshedpur) are located here.
*   **Western India (Gujarat/Maharashtra):** Rich in **Petroleum** (Ankleshwar, Mumbai High).
*   **Southern India (Karnataka):** Rich in **Iron Ore** and **Gold** (Kolar, Hutti).
*   **Implication:** Regions without these minerals must trade or buy them, creating economic dependency.

### 5. International Conflicts (Page 10)
**Prompt:** Find out about a conflict in the international context regarding natural resources.

**Example Case: The Nile River Conflict**
*   **Countries:** Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia.
*   **Resource:** Water of the River Nile.
*   **Issue:** Ethiopia is building the "Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam" (GERD) to generate electricity. Egypt fears this will reduce the water flow reaching them, threatening their agriculture and survival.
*   **Parallel:** This is similar to the Kaveri River dispute in India, showing how trans-boundary resources require diplomatic sharing.
