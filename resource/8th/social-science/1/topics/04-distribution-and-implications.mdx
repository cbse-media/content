## Uneven Distribution

Natural resources are not distributed evenly across the Earth or within India.
*   **Geology determines availability:** Coal is found in sedimentary basins (e.g., Jharkhand, Odisha), while hydro power is viable in mountainous regions (e.g., Himachal Pradesh).
*   **Implications:** This inequality shapes human settlements, trade patterns, and international relations.

### The Impact of Distribution
1.  **Economic Growth:** Industries develop near resources (e.g., Steel plants near coal/iron mines), creating townships and employment.
2.  **Displacement:** Local populations (often indigenous) are frequently displaced to make way for mining or dams.
3.  **Conflict:**
    *   **International:** Wars have been fought to gain control over oil and minerals.
    *   **Inter-state:** Example: The conflict over sharing **Kaveri River** water between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Puducherry.

### The "Natural Resource Curse"

Economists observe a phenomenon called the **"Paradox of Plenty"** or the **"Natural Resource Curse"**.

<Callout variant="danger">
**Concept:** Having abundant natural resources does not guarantee a country is rich. In fact, resource-rich regions often experience *slower* economic growth.
</Callout>

**Why does this happen?**
1.  Economies rely solely on exporting raw materials.
2.  Failure to develop manufacturing industries that turn resources into high-value products.
3.  Corruption and conflict over the resource revenues.

**India's Approach:** India has generally avoided this by investing in industries (Factors of Production) to process resources domestically.

### Map: Mineral Distribution in India
*(Refer to Fig 1.11 in your textbook)*
*   **Iron Ore:** Found heavily in the Odisha-Jharkhand belt and Karnataka (Kudremukh, Ballari).
*   **Coal:** Concentrated in the central-eastern belt (Jharia, Bokaro, Talcher).
*   **Oil:** Found in Assam (Digboi), Gujarat (Ankleshwar), and offshore (Mumbai High).
