## Stewardship: Responsible Use

**Stewardship** means acting as caretakers of the Earth. It involves using resources in a way that enables the restoration of renewables and the judicious use of non-renewables.

### Case Study 1: Groundwater in Punjab (The Crisis)
Punjab was the heart of the **Green Revolution**, making India food self-sufficient. However, this came at a high ecological cost.

*   **Cause:**
    1.  Shift to water-intensive crops (Paddy/Rice) in the 1960s.
    2.  Free electricity supply encouraged over-pumping.
*   **Effect:**
    1.  Groundwater levels dropped drastically (inaccessible up to 30 meters depth in some areas).
    2.  80% of Punjab is classified as 'over-exploited'.
    3.  Chemical fertilizers/pesticides leached into water, causing health hazards.
*   **Lesson:** Food security was ensured for the short term, but long-term sustainability was compromised.

### Case Study 2: Organic Farming in Sikkim (The Solution)
Sikkim provides a contrasting success story of **Sustainable Agriculture**.

*   **The Transition:** Faced with declining yields and debt from chemicals, the state promoted organic farming.
*   **Method:**
    1.  Banned chemical inputs.
    2.  Used compost, neem/garlic repellents.
    3.  Adopted mixed cropping.
*   **Result:** In 2016, Sikkim became a **100% Organic State**.
    *   Biodiversity returned (insects/birds).
    *   Farmers' income grew by 20%.
    *   Tourism boomed.

**Traditional Wisdom:** *Vrikshayurveda* (Science of plant life) is an ancient text from the 10th century CE that documents sustainable practices like crop rotation and natural pest management.

### Case Study 3: The Cement Industry (Pollution Challenge)
Cement is essential for modern infrastructure but is highly polluting.
*   **Impact:** Releases fine dust damaging lungs and reducing plant yields.
*   **Mitigation:** Guidelines by the Central Pollution Control Board and a shift towards alternative materials (mud, recycled plastic).

### Case Study 4: International Solar Alliance (Renewable Future)
To combat reliance on fossil fuels, India and France launched the **International Solar Alliance (ISA)** in 2015.
*   **Goal:** Harness solar power in sunshine-rich countries.
*   **Example:** The **Bhadla Solar Park** in Rajasthan is a symbol of this transition.
*   **Lokasangraha:** A concept from the *Bhagavad Gita* meaning acting for the wellbeing of all—a guiding principle for global environmental cooperation.
