## Restoration and Regeneration

Nature functions on a principle of restoration.
*   **Restoration:** Returning something to its original healthy state after damage (e.g., a cut on skin healing).
*   **Regeneration:** Creating new life and conditions for thriving (e.g., a forest growing back after a fire).

<Callout variant="tip">
**Nature's Cycle:** In a forest, there is no waste. A fallen tree decomposes, feeding bacteria and fungi, enriching the soil, which in turn nurtures new seeds. This is a perfect closed loop.

### 1. Renewable Resources
Resources that can renew themselves over time through natural processes.
*   **Examples:** Solar energy, wind, water (replenished by rain/glaciers), forests (if allowed to regrow).

**The Critical Condition:**
Renewable resources remain renewable **only if** the rate of harvest does not exceed the rate of regeneration.
$$
\text{Sustainability Condition:} \quad \text{Rate of Extraction} \le \text{Rate of Regeneration}
$$
*   **Threat:** If we cut trees faster than they grow, forests become a non-renewable resource effectively.
*   **Impact:** Climate change and deforestation are disturbing these natural cycles (e.g., Himalayan glaciers melting faster than snowfall can replace them).

### 2. Non-Renewable Resources
Resources created over millions of years that cannot be replenished within a human timeframe.
*   **Examples:** Fossil fuels (coal, petroleum), minerals (iron, copper, gold).
*   **Status in India:** India has significant coal reserves, but at current consumption rates, they may only last another 50 years.

<Callout variant="warning">
**Resource Exhaustion:** Since non-renewables are finite, they must be used **judiciously** to stretch their availability for future generations while we transition to sustainable alternatives.
</Callout>

### Ecosystem Functions vs. Services
*   **Ecosystem Functions:** Natural workings of nature (e.g., a forest filtering water, preventing soil erosion).
*   **Ecosystem Services:** When these functions benefit humans (e.g., receiving clean drinking water, pollinated crops).
