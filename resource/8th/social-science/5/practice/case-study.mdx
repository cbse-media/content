## The Scenario
In Grade 8 of Suryodaya School, three students (Ahmed, Gurmat, Ravi) contested for Class Representative. Ms. Usha (teacher) acted as the Election Officer.

### Analysis Questions

**1. What was the role that Ms. Usha played? Why was it important?**
*   **Role:** Election Officer (similar to the Election Commission).
*   **Importance:** She ensured the process was fair, rules were followed, secrecy was maintained, and the counting was transparent. Without a neutral referee, elections can be manipulated.

**2. Why was it important to organize a braille ballot paper for Neha?**
*   **Inclusivity:** Democracy includes *everyone*. Neha has a right to vote independently and secretly just like others.
*   **Universal Franchise:** This mirrors the ECI's efforts to provide facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PwD).

**3. Why was it important to have a secret ballot?**
*   If voting was public (e.g., raising hands), students might feel pressured to vote for their friends or fear bullying. Secrecy ensures the vote reflects their true choice.

**4. Gurmat won with 12 votes out of 33. Is this fair?**
*   **System:** This is the **First-Past-The-Post** system used in India.
*   **Logic:** The candidate with the *highest* votes wins, even if they don't have a majority (>50%). While it's simple, it means 21 students (who voted for Ahmed and Ravi) are represented by someone they didn't pick.

**5. What considerations might students have had while choosing?**
*   **Issues:** Cleanliness (Ahmed) vs. Peer Learning (Gurmat) vs. Arts (Ravi).
*   **Personal Bias:** Friendship or popularity.
*   **Capability:** Who is more responsible?
*   *This mirrors real elections where voters weigh manifestos against personality.*
