## Steps in an Election

1.  **Notification:** ECI announces dates.
2.  **Nomination:** Candidates file papers to contest.
3.  **Campaigning:** Parties hold rallies, distribute manifestos, and ask for votes. Campaigning stops 48 hours before voting.
4.  **Polling Day:** Voters cast their vote.
5.  **Counting & Results:** Votes are counted, and winners declared.

## Inside the Polling Booth
On voting day, officials ensure the process is secure:
1.  **1st Polling Officer:** Checks Voter ID and name on the list.
2.  **2nd Polling Officer:** Inks the finger (indelimble ink), gives a slip, and takes a signature.
3.  **3rd Polling Officer:** Checks the ink and activates the EVM.
4.  **Voting:** The voter presses the button on the EVM next to their chosen candidate.

### Technology in Voting

#### Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)
*   **What is it?** A device used to cast votes electronically.
*   **Benefits:** Faster counting, eco-friendly (saves paper), and reduces invalid votes.

#### VVPAT (Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail)
*   **Function:** When a button is pressed on the EVM, the VVPAT prints a slip showing the chosen symbol and candidate's name.
*   **Purpose:** It allows the voter to verify their vote and serves as a physical backup for counting disputes.

### NOTA (None of the Above)
If a voter does not like any candidate, they can press the **NOTA** button. It registers their dissatisfaction but does not affect the winning result.

**Secret Ballot:** The voting process is secret. No one knows who you voted for. This prevents intimidation and ensures free choice.
