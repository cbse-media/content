## Direct Elections (First-Past-the-Post)

In direct elections, citizens vote directly for their representatives. The candidate with the highest number of votes wins (even if less than 50%).

### 1. Lok Sabha (General Elections)
*   **Level:** National.
*   **Constituencies:** India is divided into **543** parliamentary constituencies.
*   **Representatives:** Elected members are called **Members of Parliament (MPs)**.
*   **Outcome:** The party/coalition with the majority forms the Central Government. The leader becomes the **Prime Minister**.

### 2. State Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabha)
*   **Level:** State.
*   **Constituencies:** States are divided into smaller assembly constituencies.
*   **Representatives:** Elected members are called **Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs)**.
*   **Outcome:** The majority party forms the State Government. The leader becomes the **Chief Minister**.

## Indirect Elections (Proportional Representation)

In indirect elections, citizens do not vote directly. Instead, their elected representatives vote on their behalf.

### 1. Rajya Sabha (Council of States)
*   **Elected By:** Elected MLAs of State Assemblies.
*   **System:** Single Transferable Vote (STV).
*   **Nature:** It is a **Permanent House** (never dissolved). Members serve a **6-year term**, with 1/3rd retiring every two years.
*   **Composition:** 233 elected + 12 nominated by the President.

### 2. President & Vice President
*   **President:** Elected by an **Electoral College** consisting of elected MPs (Lok Sabha + Rajya Sabha) and elected MLAs of all States/UTs.
*   **Vice President:** Elected by members of both houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha + Rajya Sabha).
