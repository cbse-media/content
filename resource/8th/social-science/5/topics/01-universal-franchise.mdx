## What is Universal Adult Franchise?

Universal Adult Franchise means that **every adult citizen** of a country has the right to vote, and **each vote has equal value**.

*   **Eligibility:** In India, every citizen aged **18 years and above** has the right to vote.
*   **No Discrimination:** This right is granted irrespective of caste, creed, race, religion, gender, education, or income.
*   **Constitutional Basis:** Article 326 of the Constitution of India guarantees this right.

**Did You Know?**
India granted voting rights to women from the very beginning (1950), unlike many Western countries like Switzerland (1971) or the USA (1920) where women had to fight long battles for suffrage.

### Why is it Important?
1.  **Equality:** It treats everyone as equal.
2.  **Empowerment:** It gives people the power to choose their representatives and hold them accountable.
3.  **Inclusivity:** It ensures that the voice of the poor and marginalized is heard just as loudly as the rich.

### Voter Registration
To exercise this right, a citizen must be registered in the **voter list** of their constituency.
*   **Exception:** Individuals found guilty of certain serious crimes may be barred from voting.

### Accessibility Measures
The Election Commission ensures no voter is left behind:
*   **Home Voting:** For the elderly (85+) and people with disabilities (PwD).
*   **Assistive Tech:** Braille-enabled ballots, wheelchair assistance, and pick-up/drop-off facilities.
