A core pillar of this democracy is the principle of **Universal Adult Franchise**, which ensures that every adult citizen has the right to vote, regardless of their background. This chapter explores how India's massive electoral system works, who manages it, and how citizens participate in shaping their government.

— *Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, Constituent Assembly Debates (1949)*
