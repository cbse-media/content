# The Parliamentary System: Legislature and Executive

The Constitution of India is not just a legal document; it is a vehicle of life. It establishes the framework for how our country is governed, placing the Parliament at the center of our democracy. This chapter explores the structure of the Indian Parliament, the roles of the Legislature and the Executive, and how they function at both the Union and State levels.

## The Big Questions

As we navigate this chapter, we will answer the following critical questions:

1.  **What is India’s parliamentary system, and how is it structured?**
2.  **What are the key functions of the Parliament?**
3.  **What are the roles of the legislature and the executive in India’s Parliamentary democracy?**
4.  **How are the legislature and the executive organised at the union and state levels?**

## Introduction

India achieved independence after a long struggle, granting its citizens the power to make decisions about their own governance. The Constitution laid the foundation for this by establishing **Universal Adult Franchise**, guaranteeing every adult citizen the right to vote regardless of their background.

The people of India directly elect representatives to the **Lok Sabha**. The majority group forms the government. The **Parliament** is the supreme legislative body, comprising all elected representatives. It guides the government, ensuring it functions with the people's consent.
