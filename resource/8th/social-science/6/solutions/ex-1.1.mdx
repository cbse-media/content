## Chapter Assessment

### 1. Representatives from your State
**Question:** Find out how many representatives from your state are in each House of the Parliament.
**Guidance:** This answer depends on which state you live in.
*   *Example (Maharashtra):* Lok Sabha: 48 seats; Rajya Sabha: 19 seats.
*   *Example (Uttar Pradesh):* Lok Sabha: 80 seats; Rajya Sabha: 31 seats.
*   *Task:* Check a current general knowledge resource or government website for your specific state.

### 2. Parliament as "Voice of the People"
**Question:** What makes the Indian Parliament the “voice of the people”? How does it ensure that different opinions are heard?
**Answer:**
The Parliament is the "voice of the people" because:
1.  **Direct Election:** Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by citizens via Universal Adult Franchise.
2.  **Representation:** It comprises representatives from diverse backgrounds, regions, and communities across India.
3.  **Debate:** It ensures different opinions are heard through mechanisms like the **Question Hour**, where the Opposition questions the government, and debates on Bills, where amendments can be proposed.

### 3. Executive Responsibility
**Question:** Why do you think the Constitution made the Executive responsible to the Legislature?
**Answer:**
This is to ensure **accountability** and prevent dictatorship.
1.  The Executive (PM and Council) exercises vast power.
2.  By making them answerable to the Legislature (which represents the people), the Constitution ensures that power is used for the public good.
3.  If the Executive loses the confidence (majority support) of the Lok Sabha, the government falls.

### 4. Bicameralism at Union Level
**Question:** Why do you think we have chosen the system of bicameral legislature at the Union level?
**Answer:**
1.  **Checks and Balances:** A second house (Rajya Sabha) reviews bills passed by the Lok Sabha, preventing hasty legislation.
2.  **Federal Representation:** India is a union of states. The Rajya Sabha represents the interests of the States, ensuring the federal structure is respected.
3.  **Expertise:** It allows for distinguished people (nominated members) to contribute to governance.

### 5. Tracking a Bill
**Question:** Try to track the journey of a recent bill passed by the Parliament.
**Activity Tip:**
*   Select a recent bill (e.g., The Women's Reservation Bill, 2023).
*   **Introduced In:** Lok Sabha.
*   **Debates:** Note the arguments for and against.
*   **Time Taken:** Look at the dates of introduction vs. passing.
*   **Source:** Use `loksabha.nic.in` or news archives.

### 6. Role-Play: Model Parliament
**Activity:**
*   **Goal:** Enact the passing of a law.
*   **Roles:** Speaker (controls the house), Prime Minister (proposes), Opposition Leader (questions), President (signs).
*   **Process:** Introduce Bill -> Debate -> Vote -> Assent.

### 7. Women's Reservation Bill Delay
**Question:** The Women’s Reservation Bill, 2023, was passed with wide support. Why might it have taken over 25 years for this bill to be passed, despite being discussed for so long?
**Answer:**
*   **Lack of Consensus:** Political parties disagreed on the details (e.g., quotas within quotas).
*   **Coalition Politics:** Previous governments often relied on coalition partners who opposed the bill, making it risky to pass.
*   **Political Will:** It requires strong political determination to change the status quo of male-dominated representation.

### 8. Impact of Disruptions
**Question:** What impact do disruptions have on the quality of laws and trust?
**Answer:**
1.  **Quality of Laws:** When bills are passed in a rush amidst noise without debate, flaws in the law might be overlooked.
2.  **Trust:** Citizens elect MPs to work. Frequent disruptions make people feel their tax money and votes are being wasted, leading to cynicism and loss of trust in democratic institutions.

### 9. Interest Groups & Questions
**Activity:**
*   **MP Questions (National Policy):** "What steps is the central government taking to reduce inflation?" or "How will the new education policy affect college entrance?"
*   **MLA Questions (State/Local):** "When will the roads in our district be repaired?" or "Why is the local government school lacking teachers?"

### 10. Role of Judiciary
**Question:** What is the role that the Judiciary plays in Indian democracy? What could happen if we didn’t have an independent judiciary?
**Answer:**
*   **Role:** It interprets laws, settles disputes, and acts as the guardian of the Constitution (checking Legislature and Executive).
*   **Without Independence:**
    *   The government could violate Fundamental Rights without consequence.
    *   Powerful politicians could manipulate laws for personal gain.
    *   The federal balance between Centre and States could collapse.
