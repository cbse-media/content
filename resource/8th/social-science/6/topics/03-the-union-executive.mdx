## Components of the Union Executive
The Union Executive implements laws and runs the government. It consists of:
1.  The President
2.  The Vice President
3.  The Council of Ministers (headed by the Prime Minister)

## 1. The President
*   **Role:** Head of State and nominal head of the Executive.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Appoints the Prime Minister and other ministers.
    *   Summons the Parliament.
    *   Gives assent to bills.
*   **Power:** Acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers but has discretionary powers during political crises.

## 2. The Prime Minister (PM)
*   **Role:** The *de facto* (actual) executive authority.
*   **Appointment:** The President appoints the leader of the majority party or coalition in the Lok Sabha as PM.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Leads the Council of Ministers.
    *   Advises the President.
    *   Coordinates work among different ministries.
    *   Shapes national policies.

## 3. The Council of Ministers
*   **Composition:** Chosen from MPs of both houses.
*   **Responsibility:** Collectively responsible to the **Lok Sabha**.
*   **Civil Servants:** A permanent group of officials (bureaucrats) assists the ministers in implementing laws and ensuring departments run smoothly.

**Example of Moral Responsibility**
In 1956, Railway Minister **Lal Bahadur Shastri** resigned after a train accident. Though not personally to blame, he believed a minister must take moral responsibility for their ministry. This set a high standard for accountability.

### Separation of Powers?
Even though the Executive is drawn from the Legislature (Ministers must be MPs), there is a functional separation:
*   **Legislature:** Makes laws.
*   **Executive:** Enforces laws.
*   **Judiciary:** Checks if laws/actions are constitutional.
