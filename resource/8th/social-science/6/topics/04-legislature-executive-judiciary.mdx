## The Judiciary: Role of Checks and Balances
The Judiciary (system of courts) interprets laws and settles disputes. It plays a pivotal role in the **System of Checks and Balances**:

1.  **Guardian of Constitution:** Ensures all branches operate within constitutional limits.
2.  **Judicial Review:**
    *   If the **Legislature** passes a law violating the Constitution, the Judiciary can strike it down.
    *   If the **Executive** implements a law in a way that violates rights, the Judiciary can intervene.
3.  **Separation of Powers:** This system ensures no single organ (Legislature, Executive, or Judiciary) becomes too powerful.
