## Challenges Faced by the Legislature
While the Parliament is the platform for debate, it faces several hurdles:
1.  **Disruptions:** Sessions are often cut short due to protests or angry debates, reducing time for constructive work.
2.  **Productivity:** Measured by hours functioned vs. scheduled. Data shows a decline in productivity in recent years (e.g., Rajya Sabha productivity fell to 35.75% in 2018 due to disruptions).
3.  **Absenteeism:** Regular absence of members.
4.  **Criminalization:** Concerns exist about representatives with criminal cases against them.

## The Role of Media and Citizens
*   **Media:** Plays a crucial role in communicating the concerns of the electorate, often using cartoons and reports to highlight issues.
*   **Citizens:** Democracy strengthens when citizens stay informed. Engaging in public discussions, using digital spaces for policy feedback, and constructive engagement with representatives are vital.

**Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Message**
*"Governments will come and go, parties will rise and fall. But the nation must endure, and its democracy must live on."*
This highlights that protecting democratic values is more important than political power.
