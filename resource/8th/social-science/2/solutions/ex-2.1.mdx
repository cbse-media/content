## Questions and Activities

### 1. Compare the political strategies of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals. What similarities and differences existed between them?

**Answer:**
*   **Similarities:**
    *   Both were of foreign origin (Turkic/Central Asian).
    *   Both relied on military conquest to establish power.
    *   Both used land-revenue assignment systems for administration (Iqta for Sultans, Jagir for Mughals).
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Succession:** Sultanate successions were often violent and unstable (avg reign 9 years). Mughals established a more stable dynastic rule (avg reign 27 years).
    *   **Integration:** The Sultanate often ruled by force and exclusion (Jizya). The Mughals, especially under Akbar, focused on assimilation, alliances (marrying Rajputs), and cultural synthesis.
    *   **Administration:** The Mughal **Mansabdari system** was more structured and centralized compared to the Iqtadari system.

### 2. Why did kingdoms like the Vijayanagara Empire and the Ahom Kingdom manage to resist conquest for a longer time compared to others?

**Answer:**
*   **Geography:**
    *   **Ahoms:** Used the difficult terrain of Assam (hills, dense forests, Brahmaputra river) to wage guerrilla warfare, which confused conventional armies.
    *   **Vijayanagara:** Located in the rocky terrain of the Deccan, far from the center of Muslim power in Delhi.
*   **Military Innovation:**
    *   **Ahoms:** The *Paik system* ensured a massive, mobilized militia.
    *   **Vijayanagara:** Built massive fortifications and maintained a powerful cavalry.
*   **Social Cohesion:** Both kingdoms fostered strong regional identities and integrated local populations/tribes into their defense.

### 3. Imagine you are a scholar in the court of Akbar or Krishnadevaraya. Write a letter to a friend describing the politics, trade, culture, and society you are witnessing.

**Answer:**
*(Student creativity required. Key points to include:)*
*   **If Akbar's Court:** Mention the *Ibadat Khana* (interfaith discussions), the presence of Jesuits and Rajputs, the translation of Mahabharata, and the busy construction of Fatehpur Sikri.
*   **If Krishnadevaraya's Court:** Mention the grandeur of Hampi, the musical pillars, the trade with Portuguese (buying horses), and the literary assemblies patronizing Telugu and Sanskrit.

### 4. How come Akbar, a ruthless conqueror in his young days, grew tolerant and benevolent after some years? What could have led to such a change?

**Answer:**
Akbar's shift was likely driven by:
1.  **Pragmatism:** He realized that to rule a vast, Hindu-majority land like India, he needed the support of the local populace (Rajputs), not their enmity.
2.  **Intellectual Curiosity:** He engaged with scholars of all faiths (Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians) in his *Ibadat Khana*, which broadened his worldview.
3.  **Maturation:** Moving away from the influence of orthodox regents (like Bairam Khan) allowed him to develop his own philosophy of *Sulh-i-kul* (Peace with all).

### 5. What might have happened if the Vijayanagara Empire had won the Battle of Talikota?

**Answer:**
If Vijayanagara had won:
*   **Political:** It would have likely remained the dominant power in South India, preventing the fragmentation that allowed the Mughals (and later the British) to penetrate the south easily.
*   **Cultural:** The destruction of Hampi would have been averted, preserving countless temples and manuscripts.
*   **Religious:** The balance of power in the Deccan would have remained tilted towards the Hindu empire rather than the Sultanates.

### 6. Many values promoted by early Sikhism, including equality, seva, and justice, remain relevant today. Select one of these values and discuss how it remains relevant.

**Answer:**
**Value: Seva (Selfless Service)**
*   **relevance:** In today's world of inequality and crisis, the Sikh practice of Seva is vital. We see it in *Langars* (community kitchens) feeding the hungry regardless of caste or religion, and in Sikh volunteers often being the first responders during natural disasters. It promotes community bonding and empathy, which are essential for a peaceful modern society.

### 7. Imagine you are a trader in a port city (Surat, Calicut or Hooghly). Describe the scenes you see.

**Answer:**
"I stand at the bustling port of Surat. The air smells of salt and spices. Ships from faraway lands—Arab dhows and large European vessels—are docked. I see bales of fine cotton textiles and indigo being loaded. Merchants are haggling in Persian and local dialects. Men are exchanging *Hundis* instead of heavy coin bags. There is a mix of people: Arab traders, Portuguese officials, and local Baniyas, all connected by the flow of gold and silver entering our land."
