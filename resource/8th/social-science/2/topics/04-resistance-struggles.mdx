## The Rajputs
The Rajputs of Rajasthan were fierce defenders of their independence.
*   **Rana Sanga:** Fought Babur at Khanwa.
*   **Maharana Pratap (Mewar):** Refused to submit to Akbar.
    *   **Battle of Haldighati (1576):** Fought valiantly against the Mughal army. Though the Mughals had the upper hand, Pratap escaped and waged **guerrilla warfare** from the Aravalli hills for years.
    *   **Tribal Support:** He was aided by the **Bhil** tribe, whose warriors are featured on the Mewar emblem.

## The Gonds
*   **Rani Durgavati (Garha Kingdom):** A valiant Gond queen who ruled a prosperous kingdom.
*   **Conflict:** She fought Akbar's army in 1564. Despite being outnumbered, she led her troops and ultimately took her own life to avoid capture. She remains a symbol of regional pride.

## The Ahoms (Assam)
The Ahoms migrated from Myanmar in the 13th century and established a kingdom in the Brahmaputra Valley.
*   **Paik System:** A unique system of forced labor/militia where every able-bodied man rendered service to the state. This allowed for a massive standing army.
*   **Battle of Saraighat (1671):**
    *   **Commander:** **Lachit Borphukan**.
    *   **Strategy:** Used the terrain (river, hills, forests) and guerrilla tactics to defeat the much larger Mughal fleet commanded by Ram Singh.
    *   **Result:** Ahoms preserved their independence.

## Other Rebellions
*   **Jat Peasantry:** Rebelled against oppressive Mughal taxation in the 17th century.
*   **Tribal Groups:** Bhils, Kolis, and Santhals frequently resisted annexation and taxation.
