## Establishment: Babur
*   **Origin:** Babur, a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan, came from Central Asia (Uzbekistan).
*   **First Battle of Panipat (1526):** Babur defeated **Ibrahim Lodi**.
*   **Technology:** His victory was due to the use of **gunpowder, field artillery, and matchlock guns**, which were new to Indian warfare.

## Consolidation: Akbar (r. 1556–1605)
Akbar ascended the throne at age 13. His reign represents a blend of conquest and diplomacy.
*   **Conquest:** Brutal seiges (e.g., Chittorgarh) initially, followed by strategic alliances.
*   **Diplomacy:** He married Rajput princesses and appointed Rajputs to high positions.
*   **Religious Policy:**
    *   Abolished the **Jizya** tax.
    *   Promoted **Sulh-i-kul** (Peace with all).
    *   Established the *Ibadat Khana* for interfaith dialogue.
    *   Translated Sanskrit texts (Mahabharata, Ramayana) into Persian.

## Expansion and Decline: Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707)
Aurangzeb seized power after a bloody war of succession, executing his brothers (including Dara Shikoh) and imprisoning his father, Shah Jahan.
*   **Expansion:** The empire reached its greatest territorial extent.
*   **Policy Shift:**
    *   Reimposed **Jizya** and pilgrimage taxes.
    *   Banned music and dance at court.
    *   Ordered the destruction of temples (Kashi Vishwanath, Mathura) and Gurudwaras.
*   **The Decline:** His constant wars in the Deccan for 25 years drained the treasury. His harsh religious policies alienated the Rajputs, Sikhs, and Marathas, leading to endless rebellions.
