## Rise and Fall of the Sultanate

The **Delhi Sultanate** was established after the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan in 1192. It marked the beginning of rule by five successive dynasties of Turkic-Afghan origin:
1.  **Mamluks** (Slave Dynasty)
2.  **Khiljis** (Khaljis)
3.  **Tughlaqs**
4.  **Sayyids**
5.  **Lodis**

<Callout variant="warning">
**Political Instability:** The succession of power was often violent. Almost two out of three sultans seized power by eliminating their predecessor. The average reign of a sultan was hardly **nine years**.

### Key Rulers and Policies

#### Ala-ud-din Khilji (Early 14th Century)
*   **Military Expansion:** Conducted campaigns across north and central India.
*   **Defense:** Repelled several Mongol invasions.
*   **Self-Image:** Minted coins calling himself 'Sikander Sani' (The Second Alexander).
*   **Southward Expansion:** His general, **Malik Kafur**, raided wealthy southern kingdoms (Srirangam, Madurai), plundering immense wealth to finance the army.

#### Muhammad bin Tughlaq
*   **Ambition:** Controlled a vast part of the Subcontinent.
*   **Failed Experiments:**
    1.  **Capital Transfer:** Moved capital from Delhi to **Daulatabad** (Devagiri) to have a central base, then moved it back. This caused immense hardship and loss of life.
    2.  **Token Currency:** Introduced copper coins with the value of silver/gold. Without security features, counterfeiting became rampant, collapsing the economy.

### Resistance to the Sultanate
The Sultanate constantly faced resistance from neighboring kingdoms:
*   **Eastern Gangas (Odisha):** King **Narasimhadeva I** defeated the Sultanate's forces and built the Sun Temple at Konark.
*   **Hoysalas (South India):** Fended off attacks for a long time before eventually being absorbed into the rising Vijayanagara Empire.

### Impact on Society
*   **Plunder & Iconoclasm:** Wealth was often amassed by raiding temples. This was motivated by greed (plunder) and religious iconoclasm (destruction of idols).
*   **Taxation:** Imposition of **Jizya**, a discriminatory tax on non-Muslims.
