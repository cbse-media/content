## The Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1646)

As the Delhi Sultanate weakened, a powerful empire emerged in the south. Established in **1336** by two brothers, **Harihara and Bukka**, Vijayanagara (City of Victory) became a bastion of resistance and cultural renaissance.

### Krishnadevaraya (16th Century)
The empire reached its zenith under **Krishnadevaraya**.
*   **Military:** Secured dominance over the Deccan.
*   **Culture:** Patronized Sanskrit, Telugu, and Kannada scholars. He wrote *Amuktamalyada* (Telugu epic on statecraft).
*   **Architecture:** Built grand temples like the **Vitthala Temple** with its musical pillars.
*   **Trade:** Foreign travelers (like Domingo Paes) described the capital (Hampi) as large as Rome, wealthy, and bustling with trade in horses, silk, and gems.

### Fall of Vijayanagara
*   **Battle of Talikota (1565):** The Deccan Sultanates formed a coalition and defeated the Vijayanagara army. The city was sacked and left in ruins.

## The Bahmani Sultanate
Established in **1347** as a rival to Vijayanagara in the Deccan.
*   It eventually fragmented into five independent **Deccan Sultanates**:
    1.  Bijapur
    2.  Golconda
    3.  Ahmednagar
    4.  Berar
    5.  Bidar
