## Origins
*   **Guru Nanak (15th Century):** Founded Sikhism with the message of *Ik Onkar* (One God), equality, and compassion.
*   **Scripture:** *Guru Granth Sahib*, first compiled by Guru Arjan.

## Conflict with the State
As the movement grew, it faced persecution from Mughal rulers.
1.  **Guru Arjan:** Tortured to death by Jahangir.
2.  **Guru Hargobind:** Introduced martial training in response.
3.  **Guru Tegh Bahadur (9th Guru):**
    *   Stood up for the rights of Kashmiri Pandits facing forced conversion.
    *   Executed (beheaded) by Aurangzeb in 1675 at Chandni Chowk (site of **Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib**).

## The Khalsa
*   **Guru Gobind Singh (10th Guru):** Established the **Khalsa** in **1699**.
*   **Nature:** A martial brotherhood committed to justice and defense of the faith.
*   **Legacy:** The Sikhs fought relentless battles against the Mughals. Later, **Maharaja Ranjit Singh** united the confederacies into a powerful Sikh Empire in the 19th century.
