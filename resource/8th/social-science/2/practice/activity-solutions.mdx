## In-Text Prompts

### Page 6: Why did Ala-ud-din Khilji call himself 'the second Alexander'?
**Answer:** Alexander the Great was known as a world conqueror. Ala-ud-din Khilji had immense territorial ambitions; he conquered large parts of India and even dreamed of a world conquest. By minting 'Sikander Sani' on his coins, he was projecting his image as an invincible emperor comparable to Alexander.

### Page 6: Resources for War
**Prompt:** What resources were needed to maintain an army?
**Answer:**
1.  **Money:** To pay soldiers (cash or land grants).
2.  **Food/Supplies:** Massive grain stores for men and animals.
3.  **Livestock:** Horses for cavalry, elephants for shock troops, oxen for transport.
4.  **Metal/Iron:** For weapons (swords, armor) and later, cannons.
5.  **Labor:** For building roads and forts.

### Page 8: Image vs Idol
**Prompt:** Why use 'image' instead of 'idol'?
**Answer:** 'Idol' often carries a negative connotation in Abrahamic religions (idolatry). In Indian traditions, the terms *Murti* or *Vigraha* imply a vessel for the divine presence, not just a statue. 'Image' is a neutral historical term that avoids religious bias.

### Page 11: Location of Forts (Kumbhalgarh)
**Prompt:** Why were such locations (steep hills) chosen?
**Answer:**
*   **Pros:** High altitude provides a vantage point to spot enemies. Steep slopes make it difficult for elephants and siege engines to approach.
*   **Cons:** Logistics—getting food and water up to the fort is difficult during a long siege.

### Page 20: Akbar's Strategies vs Earlier Rulers
**Prompt:** Why did Akbar use different strategies (marriage, tolerance) compared to earlier rulers who relied on force?
**Answer:** Earlier rulers viewed themselves as occupiers ruling a hostile population. Akbar wanted to build an *Indian* empire. He realized that constant warfare was expensive and unstable. By winning the loyalty of the Rajputs through marriage and respect, he turned potential enemies into his strongest generals, stabilizing the empire from within.

### Page 25: Aurangzeb's Letters
**Prompt:** "I have not done well for the country... I am departing helpless." What does this tell us?
**Answer:** It reveals deep regret and realization of failure. Despite being the most powerful emperor territorially, Aurangzeb realized at the end of his life that his endless wars and rigid policies had left the empire fractured, the treasury empty, and the people unhappy. It humanizes him as a ruler who ultimately lost the "war" for stability despite winning battles.

### Page 28: The Paik System (Ahoms)
**Prompt:** How did it affect daily lives?
**Answer:**
*   **Challenge:** Families lost their men to state service (rotation basis) for months, affecting agriculture and family life.
*   **Benefit:** It created a strong sense of civic duty and collective defense. It also ensured that public works (dams, roads) were built efficiently without needing a massive tax-funded budget.
