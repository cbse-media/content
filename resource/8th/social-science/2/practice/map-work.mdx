## Map Comparisons

### 1. Fig 2.3: Tughlaqs vs Lodis vs Regional Powers
![Map of Tughlaq and Lodi territories](./placeholder.png)
*   **Observation:** The Tughlaq empire (shaded area) covered almost the entire subcontinent at its peak. In contrast, the Lodi empire (later period) had shrunk back to North India.
*   **Regional Powers:** Notice the large territories of the **Eastern Gangas** (Odisha) and **Hoysalas** (South), showing that the Sultanate never fully controlled the periphery.

### 2. Fig 2.12: The Deccan and Vijayanagara
![Map of Deccan Sultanates and Vijayanagara](./placeholder.png)
*   **Buffer Zones:** The Raichur Doab (land between rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra) was a constant bone of contention between Vijayanagara and the Bahmani/Deccan Sultanates.
*   **Fragmented North:** The Bahmani kingdom split into five smaller pieces (Bijapur, Golconda, etc.), while Vijayanagara remained a massive unified block in the South until 1565.

### 3. Fig 2.16: Mughal Expansion
![Map of Mughal Empire under Akbar vs Aurangzeb](./placeholder.png)
*   **Akbar (Green):** Controlled North and Central India firmly.
*   **Aurangzeb (Stripes):** Pushed the boundaries deep south.
*   **The Difference:** Aurangzeb's expansion into the deep south made the empire too big to manage from Delhi, stretching supply lines and communication, leading to its eventual collapse.
