## Introduction

The Colonial Era marks a transformative and often traumatic period in Indian history. It explains how European powers, particularly the British, transformed from traders seeking spices into imperial rulers controlling the entire subcontinent. This chapter explores the methods of conquest, the economic devastation caused by policies like the "Drain of Wealth," and the resilient spirit of Indians who resisted foreign rule.
