## Short Answer Questions

### Q1: What was the "Cartaz" system?
**Answer:** A naval pass system introduced by the Portuguese. Any ship trading in the Indian Ocean had to buy a pass from the Portuguese; otherwise, it would be confiscated or sunk. This established their monopoly on the sea.

### Q2: Why is 1858 a significant year in Indian history?
**Answer:** It marks the end of the **East India Company's rule** and the beginning of the **British Raj** (direct rule by the Crown). Queen Victoria issued a proclamation promising rights (which were largely not kept).

### Q3: How did the "Indigo Revolt" differ from the "1857 Rebellion"?
**Answer:**
*   **1857:** Was a military and political uprising involving sepoys and princes aiming to overthrow British rule.
*   **Indigo Revolt (1859):** Was a specific peasant movement against European planters regarding forced cultivation of a cash crop. It was supported by the Bengali intelligentsia and legal means, rather than just armed conflict.
