## Painting Analysis (Fig 4.14)
**Prompt:** Analyze "The East offering its riches to Britannia".
**Analysis:**
*   **Britannia:** Sits high up on a rock, holding a trident (naval power) and shield (Union Jack). She looks down, symbolizing superiority.
*   **India:** Depicted as a dark-skinned woman offering pearls/jewels, looking up in a submissive posture.
*   **Symbolism:** It justifies colonialism as a "voluntary" submission where the East *offers* wealth, rather than it being looted. The "Old Father Thames" pouring water represents London receiving this wealth.
*   **Reality:** It was theft, not an offering.

## "The Sun Never Sets..."
**Prompt:** What does "the sun never sets on the British Empire" mean?
**Answer:**
*   **Meaning:** The British Empire was so vast, spanning across globe (Canada, India, Australia, Africa), that it was always daylight in at least one part of their territory.
*   **Symbolism:** It represented their global dominance.

## Macaulay's Quote
**Prompt:** What did Macaulay mean by "A single shelf of European library..."?
**Answer:**
*   **Meaning:** He displayed extreme **arrogance and ignorance**. He dismissed thousands of years of Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian literature, philosophy, and science as worthless compared to Western thought.
*   **Goal:** To justify erasing Indian culture and replacing it with English education to create obedient civil servants.

## "Brown Englishmen"
**Prompt:** Why make Indians "English in taste..."?
**Answer:**
The British needed a buffer class—Indians who looked like the natives but thought like the British. These "Brown Englishmen" would:
1.  Act as loyal intermediaries between the rulers and the masses.
2.  Provide cheap labor for administration (clerks).
3.  Become consumers of British goods.

## "Re-opened" India
**Prompt:** Why use the term "re-opened" India to the world?
**Answer:**
India had been connected to the world (Rome, China, SE Asia) for millennia through trade. The colonial period didn't "open" a closed India; it forced India into a *new, unequal* relationship dominated solely by Europe, breaking its traditional Asian trade links.
