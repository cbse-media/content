## Deindustrialization
Before the 18th century, India was the "textile workshop of the world."
*   **British Policy:**
    1.  Imposed heavy duties on Indian textiles entering Britain.
    2.  Flooded India with cheap, machine-made British cloth with minimal tariffs.
*   **Result:** The Indian handloom industry collapsed. Artisans were forced back into agriculture, overburdening the land.
    > *"The bones of the cotton weavers are bleaching the plains of India."* — William Bentinck (1834)

## The "Drain of Wealth"
Scholars like **Dadabhai Naoroji** (*Poverty and Un-British Rule in India*) and **R.C. Dutt** documented how wealth was siphoned from India to Britain.
*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   Taxes collected in India used to buy goods for export (effectively getting goods for free).
    *   Salaries and pensions of British officials paid from Indian revenue.
    *   India paying for British wars abroad.
*   **Estimate:** Recent studies suggest **$45 trillion** was extracted from India between 1765 and 1938.

## Devastating Famines
Colonial policies transformed droughts into catastrophic famines.
1.  **Bengal Famine (1770):** Killed ~10 million (1/3rd of the population). Caused by rigid tax collection despite crop failure.
2.  **Great Famine (1876–1878):** Killed up to 8 million.
    *   **Laissez-Faire:** Viceroy Lord Lytton refused to interfere with market prices.
    *   **Export of Grain:** While Indians starved, millions of tonnes of wheat were exported to Britain.

**Railways:** Often cited as a benefit, railways were built primarily to move raw materials to ports and troops to trouble spots. They were paid for by Indian taxpayers, but profits went to British investors.
