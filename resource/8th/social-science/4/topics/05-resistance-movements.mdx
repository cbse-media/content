## Early Uprisings
Resistance began almost immediately after conquest.

### 1. Sannyasi-Fakir Rebellion (Bengal)
*   **Context:** Post-1770 famine.
*   **Action:** Hindu Sannyasis and Muslim Fakirs attacked British treasuries.
*   **Legacy:** Inspired Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel *Anandamath* and the song *Vande Mataram*.

### 2. Tribal Uprisings
Tribals faced loss of forest rights and exploitation by moneylenders.
*   **Kol Uprising (1831):** Chota Nagpur.
*   **Santhal Rebellion (1855):** Led by **Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu**. They declared independence and fought with bows against guns. Though brutally suppressed, it showed immense courage.

### 3. Peasant Uprisings
*   **Indigo Revolt (1859):** Peasants in Bengal refused to grow indigo for European planters who paid them negligible prices.

## The Great Rebellion of 1857
Often called the "Sepoy Mutiny" by the British, but widely regarded as the **First War of Independence** by Indians.

### Causes
*   **Political:** Doctrine of Lapse (Annexation of Jhansi, Awadh).
*   **Economic:** Heavy taxation and ruin of artisans.
*   **Military/Religious:** The **Greased Cartridges** (rumored to contain cow and pig fat) offended Hindu and Muslim sepoys.

### Key Leaders
*   **Mangal Pandey:** His revolt at Barrackpore sparked the uprising.
*   **Bahadur Shah Zafar:** Proclaimed Emperor of India by rebels in Delhi.
*   **Rani Lakshmibai:** Defended Jhansi; died fighting.
*   **Begum Hazrat Mahal:** Led the resistance in Lucknow/Awadh.
*   **Nana Saheb & Tatia Tope:** Led forces in Kanpur.

### Outcome
*   **Suppression:** The British recaptured Delhi and other centers with extreme brutality.
*   **End of EIC:** The **Government of India Act 1858** transferred power directly to the British Crown. Queen Victoria promised non-interference in religion, but the trust was broken.
