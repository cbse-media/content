## Education: "Brown Englishmen"
The British overhauled the traditional Indian education system (*Pathshalas* and *Madrasas*).
*   **Macaulay's Minute (1835):** Thomas Macaulay argued for English education, dismissing Indian literature as inferior.
    > *"A single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia."*
*   **Objective:** To create a class of persons, **"Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect,"** who could serve as clerks in the administration.

## Destruction of Village Governance
*   **Traditional:** Indian villages were "little republics" (Charles Metcalfe) that managed their own affairs through Panchayats.
*   **Colonial:** The British introduced a centralized bureaucracy and police system.
    *   Replaced customary law with complex British legal codes.
    *   Courts became expensive and conducted in a foreign language, alienating common people.

## Cultural Theft
While the British initiated archaeology (ASI), they also engaged in the massive theft of cultural artifacts (statues, manuscripts, jewels like the Koh-i-Noor), filling European museums with Indian heritage.
