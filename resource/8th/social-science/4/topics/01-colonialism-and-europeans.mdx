## What is Colonialism?

**Colonialism** is the practice where one country takes control of another region, establishes settlements, and imposes its political, economic, and cultural systems.

*   **Motivation:** Access to natural resources, new markets, trade routes, and sometimes religious conversion ("civilising mission").
*   **Reality:** It often involved the massacre or enslavement of native populations and the exploitation of local wealth.

## Early European Powers in India

Before the British dominance, other European powers established footholds in India.

### 1. The Portuguese (Est. 1498)
*   **Arrival:** Vasco da Gama arrived at Kappad (near Kozhikode) in 1498.
*   **Strategy:** Aggressive naval dominance.
    *   **Cartaz System:** A pass required by all ships in the Arabian Sea; ships without it were seized.
    *   **Inquisition:** Established in Goa (1560), it persecuted non-Christians and forced conversions.
*   **Decline:** Displaced by Dutch and British, restricted mainly to Goa, Daman, and Diu.

### 2. The Dutch (Early 17th Century)
*   **Focus:** Commerce, primarily the **spice trade**.
*   **Settlements:** Pulicat, Nagapattinam, Surat, and Cochin.
*   **Battle of Colachel (1741):** A rare instance where an Asian power (**King Marthanda Varma** of Travancore) decisively defeated a European naval force. This effectively ended Dutch colonial ambitions in India.

### 3. The French (Est. 1664)
*   **Key Figure:** **Dupleix** (Governor-General). He pioneered the use of disciplined Indian infantry (**sepoys**) and interference in local dynastic disputes—strategies later perfected by the British.
*   **Conflict:** Fought the **Carnatic Wars** (1746–1763) against the British.
*   **Outcome:** Defeated by the British; restricted to Pondicherry and a few enclaves.
