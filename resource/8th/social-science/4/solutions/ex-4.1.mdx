## Questions and Activities

### 1. What is colonialism? Give three different definitions.
**Answer:**
1.  **General Definition:** The practice where one country takes full or partial political control over another country, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically.
2.  **Economic Definition:** A system where a 'mother country' extracts raw materials from a colony and uses it as a captive market for its finished goods.
3.  **Cultural Definition:** The imposition of the colonizer's culture, language, and education system on the native population, often justified by a "civilising mission."

### 2. Was the "civilising mission" true in the case of India?
**Answer:**
**No.** While the British introduced railways and English education, their primary motive was **profit and control**, not Indian welfare.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   They destroyed thriving Indian industries (textiles).
    *   They allowed millions to die in famines (e.g., exporting grain during the 1876 famine).
    *   They dismantled indigenous village governance.
    *   The "civilising" narrative was often a cover for racial superiority and exploitation.

### 3. How was the British approach different from Portuguese or French?
**Answer:**
*   **Portuguese:** Focused on **naval dominance** (Cartaz system) and aggressive **religious conversion** (Inquisition).
*   **French:** Focused on state-building through **military alliances** (Sepoys) but failed to secure funding/support from home.
*   **British:** Used a strategy of **"Trade first, Rule later."** They mastered the art of **"Divide and Rule,"** using Indian resources (revenue from Bengal) to conquer the rest of India. They focused heavily on establishing legal and administrative structures to ensure long-term profit.

### 4. "Indians funded their own subjugation." Explain.
**Answer:**
This means the cost of British rule was paid for by Indian taxes.
*   **Railways/Telegraph:** Built using tax revenue from Indian peasants, but served British military and trade interests.
*   **Army:** The British Indian Army was funded by Indian revenues but used to suppress Indian revolts and fight British wars abroad (e.g., China, Africa).
*   **Salaries:** High salaries of British officials were paid from the Indian treasury.

### 5. What does ‘divide and rule’ mean? Give examples.
**Answer:**
It is a strategy to gain and maintain power by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the attacker.
*   **Examples:**
    1.  **Plassey (1757):** Conspiring with Mir Jafar against Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah.
    2.  **Religious Division:** Encouraging tensions between Hindus and Muslims to prevent a unified resistance (especially after 1857).
    3.  **Princely States:** Using Subsidiary Alliances to isolate Indian rulers from each other.

### 6. Essay: Impact on Agriculture
**Answer:**
*(Brief Outline)*
*   **Pre-Colonial:** Self-sufficient villages; taxes paid in kind (share of crop).
*   **Colonial Impact:**
    *   Land turned into a commodity.
    *   Taxes demanded in **cash**, forcing farmers to sell crops immediately, often at low prices.
    *   **Commercialization:** Forced growth of cash crops (Indigo, Cotton) instead of food grains, leading to food insecurity.
*   **Legacy:** Rural debt and poverty seen today have roots in these colonial land settlements (Zamindari/Ryotwari).

### 7. Report: 1857 Rani Lakshmibai
**Answer:**
**The Jhansi Chronicle - June 1858**
*   **Headline:** The Warrior Queen Falls Fighting for Freedom.
*   **Report:** Rani Lakshmibai, refusing to surrender Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse, led her forces brilliantly. After escaping the besieged fort of Jhansi, she captured Gwalior.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   *1854:* Doctrine of Lapse applied to Jhansi.
    *   *June 1857:* Rebellion breaks out.
    *   *March 1858:* British besiege Jhansi.
    *   *June 18, 1858:* The Rani attains martyrdom on the battlefield.
*   **Quote:** British General Hugh Rose called her "the best and bravest of the rebels."

### 8. Alternate History (Creative Writing)
**Answer:**
*(Guidance)* Students should imagine an India where the Marathas or a confederacy of states modernized independently (like Japan). Perhaps the Industrial Revolution would have happened in Bengal (textiles) or Mysore (rockets/steel) without the drain of wealth. India might have remained a major global economy.

### 9. Role Play: Dadabhai Naoroji vs British Official
**Answer:**
*   **Naoroji:** "You claim to bring order, but you drain our blood. £200 million drained annually! You starve the Indian peasant to feed the British factory."
*   **Official:** "But Mr. Naoroji, we gave you railways, the telegraph, and the rule of law!"
*   **Naoroji:** "Railways to carry away our grain? Law that treats a white man differently from a brown man? This is 'Un-British' rule!"

### 10. Local Resistance Movement
**Answer:**
*(Example: Kerala - Pazhassi Raja)*
*   **Trigger:** Unfair tax on pepper and usurpation of throne.
*   **Leader:** Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (The Lion of Kerala).
*   **Tactics:** Guerrilla warfare in the Wayanad forests.
*   **Outcome:** He died fighting in 1805.
*   **Memory:** Remembered in folk songs and museums in Wayanad.
