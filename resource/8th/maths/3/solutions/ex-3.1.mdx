## Question 1
**Using sticks (Method 1), give a method for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.**

**Solution:**
1.  **Addition:** Combine the two bundles of sticks into one large bundle. The total count is the sum.
2.  **Subtraction:** To subtract collection B from collection A, remove one stick from A for every stick in B. The remaining sticks in A are the result.
3.  **Multiplication:** To multiply a collection of $N$ sticks by $M$, create $M$ identical piles of $N$ sticks each. Combine them all to get the product.
4.  **Division:** To divide $N$ sticks by $M$, distribute the sticks one by one into $M$ separate piles until you run out. The size of one pile is the quotient.

## Question 2
**Extending the 'aa' (base-26 letters) system.**

**Solution:**
This works like a spreadsheet column system (A, B... Z, AA, AB... AZ, BA...).
*   After 'z', we start with two letters: 'aa', 'ab', ... 'az'.
*   Then 'ba', 'bb' ... 'bz'.
*   This creates a base-26 bijective system (where there is no zero symbol).

## Question 3
**Make your own number system.**
*   *Student Activity:* Try using shapes like $\triangle$ for 1 and $\square$ for 5.
