## Question 1 (Chinese System)
**Why alternate between Zong (vertical) and Heng (horizontal)?**
To distinguish between place values.
*   If we used only verticals, a number like **11** (one ten, one unit) would look like `||`, which could be mistaken for **2**.
*   By alternating, 11 becomes `- |` (Horizontal 1, Vertical 1), clearly showing two different positions.

**Represent 41 with only Zongs:**
It would be `|||| |`. Without spaces, it looks like `|||||` (5). This creates ambiguity.

## Question 2 (Base-2 Gumulgal Place Value)
If we used 'ukasar' (2) and 'urapon' (1) in a place value system (Base 2):
*   Digits: 0 and 1. Gumulgal has no zero.
*   If we define urapon=1 and a new zero, then:
    *   $10_2$ (2) = 1 urapon, 0.
    *   $11_2$ (3) = 1 urapon, 1 urapon.
*   Gumulgal was additive ($2+1=3$). A positional system uses powers ($1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 3$).

## Question 4 (8 Fingers)
**If humans had 8 fingers, we would use Base-8 (Octal).**
*   **Digits:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. (No digit 8).
*   **Representation of 25 (base-10):**
    *   Base-8: $25 = 3 \times 8 + 1 \rightarrow 31_8$.
    *   Base-5: $25 = 1 \times 25 + 0 \times 5 + 0 \times 1 \rightarrow 100_5$.
    *   Base-2: $25 = 16 + 8 + 1 = 11001_2$.
