## The Ultimate System
The system we use today originated in India (~2000 years ago). It combined the best features of previous systems:
1.  **Base-10:** Intuitive (10 fingers).
2.  **Positional:** Unending numbers with few symbols.
3.  **Zero ($0$):** A true number, not just a placeholder.

## Evolution of Digits
*   **Brahmi Numerals:** Ancestors of 1-9.
*   **Gwalior Inscription:** Early written zero.
*   **Journey:** India $\to$ Arabia (Al-Khwarizmi) $\to$ Europe (Fibonacci).

## The Power of Zero
In ancient India, zero was defined as a number that results from subtracting a number from itself ($x - x = 0$). Mathematicians like **Aryabhata** and **Brahmagupta** defined rules for calculating with zero, creating a complete arithmetic system.

**Why is it called Hindu-Arabic?**
Europeans learned the system from Arab mathematicians, so they called them "Arabic numerals." Arabs called them "Hindu numerals" because they learned them from India. Today, it is properly called the **Hindu Number System**.
