## Landmark Numbers
The Roman system uses specific letters as **landmark numbers**.

| Symbol | I | V | X | L | C | D | M |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Value** | 1 | 5 | 10 | 50 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |

## Rules of Formation
1.  **Addition:** Symbols placed after a larger one are added ($VI = 5 + 1 = 6$).
2.  **Subtraction:** Symbols placed before a larger one are subtracted ($IV = 5 - 1 = 4$).
3.  **Repetition:** Symbols (I, X, C, M) can be repeated up to 3 times ($XXX = 30$). V, L, D are never repeated.

### Arithmetic Difficulty
Adding Roman numerals is cumbersome because it involves grouping and regrouping letters rather than simple column addition.

**Example:** $27 + 43$
*   $27 = XXVII$
*   $43 = XLIII$
*   Summing Is: $II + III = V$
*   Summing Xs: $XX + XL$ (This is hard to visualize directly without converting).

This difficulty paved the way for better systems.
