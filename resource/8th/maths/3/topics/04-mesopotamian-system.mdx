## Sexagesimal System (Base-60)
The Mesopotamians used **Base-60**. This legacy survives today in how we measure time (60 seconds = 1 minute) and angles (360 degrees).

## Symbols
They used only two basic marks made by a stylus on clay:
1.  **Pin/Wedge ($\triangledown$):** Represents **1**.
2.  **Hook/Angle (<):** Represents **10**.

<div class="flex justify-center my-6">
  <svg width="200" height="100" viewBox="0 0 200 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    {/* 1 */}
    <path d="M 50 20 L 60 20 L 55 60 Z" fill="currentColor"/>
    <text x="55" y="80" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">1</text>

    {/* 10 */}
    <path d="M 120 40 L 150 30 L 150 50 Z" fill="currentColor"/>
    <text x="135" y="80" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">10</text>
  </svg>
</div>

## Place Value
Numbers were written in groups. The value depended on the position (powers of 60).

**Example: 640**
$$
640 = (10 \times 60) + 40
$$
*   **Left Group (60s place):** Hook (10) representing $10 \times 60$.
*   **Right Group (1s place):** 4 Hooks (40).

**The Zero Problem:** Initially, they had no zero. A blank space was used, which could be confusing. Later, a placeholder symbol was introduced, but it wasn't a full zero number like we use today.
