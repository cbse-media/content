## Page 108: Question 11 (True/False)

**(i) A quadrilateral whose diagonals are equal and bisect each other must be a square.**
*   **False.** It is a **Rectangle**. For a square, they must also be perpendicular.

**(ii) A quadrilateral having three right angles must be a rectangle.**
*   **True.** Sum = $360$. Fourth angle = $360 - 270 = 90$. All angles 90 = Rectangle.

**(iii) A quadrilateral whose diagonals bisect each other must be a parallelogram.**
*   **True.** This is a defining property.

**(iv) A quadrilateral whose diagonals are perpendicular to each other must be a rhombus.**
*   **False.** This is true for a Kite as well. For a rhombus, they must also *bisect* each other.

**(v) A quadrilateral in which opposite angles are equal must be a parallelogram.**
*   **True.**

**(vi) A quadrilateral in which all angles are equal is a rectangle.**
*   **True.** $360/4 = 90^\circ$.

**(vii) Isosceles trapeziums are parallelograms.**
*   **False.** Only one pair of sides is parallel.
