## Carpenter's Problem (Page 83)

**Question:** A carpenter has one 8 cm strip. To make a rectangular frame, what should be the length of the other strip and where should they join?

**Solution:**
1.  **Length:** The strips act as diagonals. In a rectangle, diagonals are of equal length.
    *   Length of 2nd strip = **8 cm**.
2.  **Intersection:** Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.
    *   They should be joined at the **midpoint** of both strips (4 cm from the ends).

## Angles Between Diagonals (Page 85)

**Question:** If the angle between the diagonals is $60^\circ$ and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, find the other angles.

**Solution:**
Let the diagonals intersect at $O$. Given $\angle AOB = 60^\circ$.
Since diagonals bisect and are equal, $\Delta AOB$ is an isosceles triangle ($OA = OB$).
1.  Base angles of $\Delta AOB$: $\frac{180^\circ - 60^\circ}{2} = 60^\circ$.
2.  So $\Delta AOB$ is equilateral.
3.  Similarly, vertically opposite $\Delta DOC$ is equilateral.
4.  Adjacent angle $\angle AOD = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ$.
5.  Base angles of $\Delta AOD$: $\frac{180^\circ - 120^\circ}{2} = 30^\circ$.
6.  Corner Angle $A = 60^\circ + 30^\circ = 90^\circ$.
    *   This confirms the figure is a **Rectangle**.

## Figure It Out (Page 90)

**Question 1:** Are there non-rectangles in the given figures?
*   Figures (i), (ii), (iii) are standard rectangles.
*   Figure (iv) is a **Square** ($4 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm}$).
*   **Answer:** All are rectangles. A square is a special type of rectangle.
