## Angles in a Square (Page 93)

**Question:** What are the measures of $\angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4$ formed by the diagonal?

**Solution:**
In a square, the angle at the vertex is $90^\circ$.
The sides are equal ($AD = DC$), so the triangle formed by the diagonal ($\Delta ADC$) is an isosceles right-angled triangle.
*   $\angle 1 = \angle 3$.
*   $\angle 1 + \angle 3 + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$.
*   $2(\angle 1) = 90^\circ \Rightarrow \angle 1 = 45^\circ$.
*   **Answer:** All such angles ($\angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4$) are **$45^\circ$**.

## Figure It Out (Page 94)

**Question 1:** Find all other angles inside the rectangles.
*   **(i)** Diagonals intersect at $30^\circ$ (vertical).
    *   Side angle = $(180 - 30)/2 = 75^\circ$.
    *   Complementary angle = $90 - 75 = 15^\circ$.
*   **(ii)** Diagonals intersect at $110^\circ$.
    *   Vertical opposite = $110^\circ$. Adjacent linear pair = $70^\circ$.
    *   Base angles for $110^\circ$ triangle = $(180-110)/2 = 35^\circ$.
    *   Base angles for $70^\circ$ triangle = $(180-70)/2 = 55^\circ$.

**Question 3: Circle Diameters**
*   **Problem:** $PL$ and $AM$ are perpendicular diameters. What is $APML$?
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Diameters are equal ($PL = AM$).
    *   They bisect each other (at center $O$).
    *   They are perpendicular ($90^\circ$).
*   **Conclusion:** A quadrilateral with equal, bisecting, perpendicular diagonals is a **Square**.
