## The Puzzle (Page 111)

**Instructions:**
1.  Fold a sheet into half.
2.  Fold it once more into a quarter.
3.  Make a triangular crease at the corner that is at the middle of the paper.
4.  Open the sheet.

**Analysis:**
*   The "middle of the paper" corresponds to the center of the unfolded sheet.
*   Folding into quarters creates 4 layers.
*   A single straight crease across the corner of the folded quarter cuts through all 4 layers symmetrically.
*   When unfolded, this single line segment is reflected across the horizontal and vertical axes.

**Result:**
The shape formed is a **Rhombus**.
*   The diagonals of the unfolded shape lie along the fold lines.
*   Since the paper was folded perpendicular to the sides, the diagonals bisect each other at $90^\circ$.
*   Since the cut was straight, the resulting sides connecting the axes are straight lines forming a rhombus.

**Variations:**
*   **To get a Square:** You must fold the quarter such that the crease makes a $45^\circ$ angle with the fold edge (making an isosceles triangle at the corner). This ensures the diagonals are equal in length.
*   **To get a Kite:** Fold differently so adjacent sides are equal but the shape lacks the full symmetry of a rhombus.
