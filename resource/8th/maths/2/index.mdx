## Introduction: The Power of Folding

Have you ever heard the claim that you cannot fold a piece of paper more than 7 times?
Imagine if you could fold a sheet of paper (0.001 cm thick) as many times as you wanted.

*   **1 Fold:** Thickness doubles to 0.002 cm.
*   **10 Folds:** Thickness becomes $\approx 1$ cm.
*   **26 Folds:** Thickness is taller than the **Burj Khalifa** (830 m)!
*   **46 Folds:** Thickness reaches the **Moon**!

This rapid increase is called **Exponential Growth**. In this chapter, we will learn the mathematical language used to describe such massive numbers: **Exponents**.

## Formula Sheet: Laws of Exponents

For any non-zero integers $a, b$ and integers $m, n$:

| Law Name | Formula | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Law** | $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$ | $2^3 \times 2^4 = 2^{3+4} = 2^7$ |
| **Quotient Law** | $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$ | $5^6 \div 5^2 = 5^{6-2} = 5^4$ |
| **Power of a Power** | $(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$ | $(3^2)^4 = 3^{2 \times 4} = 3^8$ |
| **Power of a Product** | $(a \times b)^m = a^m \times b^m$ | $(2 \times 3)^2 = 2^2 \times 3^2$ |
| **Power of a Quotient** | $(\frac{a}{b})^m = \frac{a^m}{b^m}$ | $(\frac{4}{5})^3 = \frac{4^3}{5^3}$ |
| **Zero Exponent** | $a^0 = 1$ | $99^0 = 1$ |
| **Negative Exponent** | $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$ | $2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$ |
