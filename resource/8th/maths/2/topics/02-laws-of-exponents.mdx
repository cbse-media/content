## Basic Notation

An exponential expression looks like this: $a^n$.
*   **$a$** is the **Base** (the number being multiplied).
*   **$n$** is the **Exponent** (how many times to multiply the base).

$$
5^4 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625
$$

Read as: "5 raised to the power of 4".

## 1. Multiplying Powers (Same Base)

When you multiply two powers with the same base, you **add** the exponents.

$$
a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}
$$

**Why?**
$2^3 \times 2^2 = (2 \times 2 \times 2) \times (2 \times 2) = 2^{3+2} = 2^5$.

## 2. Power of a Power

When you take a power to another power, you **multiply** the exponents.

$$
(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}
$$

**Why?**
$(2^3)^2 = (2^3) \times (2^3) = 2^{3+3} = 2^{3 \times 2} = 2^6$.

## 3. Multiplying Powers (Same Exponent)

When multiplying different bases with the same exponent, you can multiply the bases first.

$$
a^m \times b^m = (a \times b)^m
$$

**Example:**
$2^3 \times 5^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 10^3 = 1000$.

## 4. Dividing Powers

When dividing powers with the same base, you **subtract** the exponents.

$$
a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}
$$

**Why?**
$$
\frac{2^5}{2^2} = \frac{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2}{2 \times 2} = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^3
$$
