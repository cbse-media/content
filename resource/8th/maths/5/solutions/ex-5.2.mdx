## Divisibility by 9 (Page 126)

**1. Check Divisibility by 9:**
*   (i) 123: Sum $1+2+3=6$ (No).
*   (ii) 405: Sum $4+0+5=9$ (Yes).
*   (iii) 8888: Sum 32 (No).
*   (iv) 93547: Sum 28 (No).
*   (v) 358095: Sum 30 (No).

**2. Smallest multiple of 9 with no odd digits.**
*   Digits must be even ($0, 2, 4, 6, 8$).
*   Sum must be 9? Impossible with only even numbers.
*   Sum must be 18.
*   Smallest number requires fewest digits, smallest leading digit.
*   Try 288: Sum 18. Even digits. **Answer: 288**.

**3. Multiple of 9 closest to 6000.**
*   $6000 \div 9$: Remainder is sum of digits $6$.
*   $6000 - 6 = 5994$. (Distance 6).
*   Next multiple: $5994 + 9 = 6003$. (Distance 3).
*   **Answer:** 6003.

**4. Multiples of 9 between 4300 and 4400.**
*   First multiple: Sum of $43xy$ needs to be 9 or 18.
*   $4+3=7$. Need 2 more. $4302$.
*   Last multiple: $4392$.
*   Sequence: $4302, 4311 \dots 4392$.
*   Count: $\frac{4392 - 4302}{9} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11$.

## Digital Roots (Page 131)

**1. Digital root of 8-digit number is 5.**
*   Add 10. $+10$ adds $1+0=1$ to the root.
*   New root = $5 + 1 = 6$.

**2. Sequence adding 11.**
*   Adding 11 is like adding 2 to the digital root (since $1+1=2$).
*   Sequence: $x, x+2, x+4 \dots$ (mod 9).

**3. Root of $9a + 36b + 13$.**
*   $9a$ and $36b$ are multiples of 9. Their digital root contribution is 9 (or 0).
*   Only 13 matters. Root of $13 = 1+3 = 4$.
*   **Answer:** 4.

**4. Conjectures:**
*   (i) Parity: A number and its digital root **do not** always share parity (e.g., 12 is even, root 3 is odd). But $N - \text{Root}(N)$ is always a multiple of 9.
*   (ii) Remainder: Digital root is the remainder mod 9.
