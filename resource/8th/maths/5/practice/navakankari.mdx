## Game Overview
**Navakankari**, also known as *Nine Men's Morris*, is a strategy game for two players. The goal is to form "mills" (lines of 3) to capture opponent pieces.

### Components
*   **Board:** Three concentric squares connected by lines at midpoints.
*   **Pieces:** 9 pawns per player (different colors).

### Rules

1.  **Placement Phase:**
    *   Players take turns placing one pawn on any empty intersection.
    *   If a player forms a **Mill** (3 in a row), they can remove one opponent's pawn (unless it is part of a mill).

2.  **Movement Phase:**
    *   Once all 9 pawns are placed, players take turns moving one pawn to an adjacent empty spot.
    *   Forming a new Mill allows removing an opponent's pawn.

3.  **Flying Phase (Optional):**
    *   When a player is reduced to 3 pawns, they may "fly" (move to *any* empty spot, not just adjacent).

### Winning Condition
*   Reduce the opponent to **2 pawns**.
*   OR Block the opponent so they cannot move.

### Strategy Tips
*   **Corners vs. Midpoints:** Midpoints offer movement in 4 directions (on the cross-lines), while corners only offer 2. Control the intersections!
*   **Double Mill:** Try to set up a formation where moving one piece back and forth closes a mill on every turn.
