## The Logic of Place Value

Any number $N$ can be written using powers of 10.
Example: $4725 = 4(1000) + 7(100) + 2(10) + 5$.

To check divisibility, we replace $10$ with remainders.

## Divisibility by 9

**Key Fact:** $10 \div 9$ leaves a remainder of $1$.
Therefore, $100, 1000, 10^n$ all leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $9$.

**Proof:**
Consider a 3-digit number $abc = 100a + 10b + c$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
N &= 100a + 10b + c \\
&= (99 + 1)a + (9 + 1)b + c \\
&= (99a + 9b) + (a + b + c)
\end{aligned}
$$
The first part $(99a + 9b)$ is clearly divisible by 9.
Therefore, $N$ is divisible by 9 if and only if $(a + b + c)$ is divisible by 9.

<Callout variant="success">
**Rule:** A number is divisible by 9 if the **sum of its digits** is divisible by 9.
</Callout>

## Divisibility by 3

**Key Fact:** $10 \div 3$ leaves a remainder of $1$.
The logic is identical to 9.
$$
N = (99a + 9b) + (a + b + c)
$$
Since $(99a + 9b)$ is divisible by 3, $N$ depends entirely on the sum of digits $(a+b+c)$.

## Divisibility by 11

**Key Fact:** Powers of 10 alternate remainders when divided by 11.
*   $1 \equiv 1$
*   $10 = 11 - 1 \equiv -1$
*   $100 = 99 + 1 \equiv 1$
*   $1000 = 1001 - 1 \equiv -1$

**Proof:**
Consider $abcd = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
N &= 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\
&\equiv (-1)a + (1)b + (-1)c + d \pmod{11} \\
&\equiv (b + d) - (a + c) \pmod{11}
\end{aligned}
$$

<Callout variant="success">
**Rule:** A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of digits at odd places and the sum of digits at even places is 0 or a multiple of 11.
</Callout>

### Composite Rules
*   **Divisibility by 6:** Must be divisible by **2** AND **3**.
*   **Divisibility by 24:** Checking 4 and 6 is NOT enough (e.g., 12 is divisible by 4 and 6 but not 24). You must check **3** and **8** (since 3 and 8 are coprime).
