## Introduction

Mathematics is often called a game of patterns. In this chapter, we move beyond simple calculation to explore the *nature* of numbers. Why do some numbers behave the way they do? How can we predict if a number is divisible by 9 without dividing? What hidden rules govern the sum of consecutive numbers?

This chapter focuses on **Generalised Forms of Numbers**, **Tests of Divisibility**, and **Logic Puzzles** (Cryptarithms).

## Key Concepts

### 1. General Form of Numbers
Any number can be written in expanded form using place values.
For a 2-digit number $ab$:
$$ ab = 10a + b $$
For a 3-digit number $abc$:
$$ abc = 100a + 10b + c $$

### 2. Parity (Even and Odd)
*   **Addition Rules:**
    *   Even + Even = Even
    *   Odd + Odd = Even
    *   Even + Odd = Odd
*   **Multiplication Rules:**
    *   Even × Any Integer = Even
    *   Odd × Odd = Odd

### 3. Divisibility Summary

| Divisor | Rule | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2** | Ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 | $10k$ is always even. |
| **3** | Sum of digits is divisible by 3 | $10 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ |
| **4** | Last two digits divisible by 4 | $100$ is divisible by 4. |
| **5** | Ends in 0 or 5 | $10k$ is divisible by 5. |
| **6** | Divisible by 2 AND 3 | Factors of 6 are coprime. |
| **9** | Sum of digits is divisible by 9 | $10 \equiv 1 \pmod 9$ |
| **10** | Ends in 0 | Definition of base 10. |
| **11** | Difference of alternating digit sums is divisible by 11 | $10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}$ |

## Topics Covered
1.  **Patterns & Parity:** Sums of consecutive numbers and logic puzzles involving signs.
2.  **Divisibility Algebra:** Using letter-numbers to prove why divisibility shortcuts work.
3.  **Digital Roots:** Repeatedly adding digits to find the "root" of a number.
4.  **Cryptarithms:** Solving puzzles where digits are disguised as letters.
