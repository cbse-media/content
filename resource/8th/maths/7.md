## Introduction

Have you ever resized an image on your computer? Sometimes it looks perfect, but other times it gets distorted—stretched too thin or squashed too wide. Why does this happen? The answer lies in **Proportional Reasoning**.

In this chapter, we explore how changing quantities while keeping their relationship constant allows us to scale images, cook recipes for larger groups, and compare prices effectively.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Ratio ($a : b$)
A ratio compares two quantities. It tells us how much of one thing there is compared to another.
*   **Notation:** $a : b$
*   **Terms:** $a$ and $b$ are called the *terms* of the ratio.
*   **Simplest Form:** Divide both terms by their Highest Common Factor (HCF).

### 2. Proportion ($a : b :: c : d$)
A proportion states that two ratios are equal.
$$ a : b :: c : d \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} $$
*   **Cross Product Property:** If two ratios are proportional, then $ad = bc$.

### 3. Sharing Quantities
To divide a quantity $X$ in the ratio $m : n$:
*   Total parts = $m + n$
*   Part 1 = $\frac{m}{m+n} \times X$
*   Part 2 = $\frac{n}{m+n} \times X$

## Formula Sheet

| Concept | Formula / Rule | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ratio** | $a : b$ | $60 : 40$ simplifies to $3 : 2$ |
| **Proportion** | $a : b :: c : d \implies \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ | $6:10 :: 18:30$ |
| **Cross Multiplication** | If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad = bc$ | Used to find unknown terms. |
| **Factor of Change** | New Value = Old Value $\times$ Factor | Width doubled means factor is 2. |
| **Unitary Method** | Find value of 1 unit first. | Cost of 1 kg = Total Cost / Total Weight |

## Topics Covered
1.  **Similarity in Change:** Observing how images scale without distortion.
2.  **Ratios:** Definition, simplification, and comparison.
3.  **Proportional Reasoning:** Solving "Rule of Three" problems.
4.  **Sharing:** Dividing quantities unevenly based on ratios.
5.  **Unit Conversions:** Essential for comparing ratios with different units.

## The Digital Image Problem

Imagine you have a picture of a tiger.
*   **Image A (Original):** Width 60 mm, Height 40 mm.
*   **Image C (Resized):** Width 30 mm, Height 20 mm.

Why does Image C look like a smaller version of A, while other resizing attempts look distorted?

### The Mathematical Reason
In Image C, both the width and the height were reduced by the **same factor**.
*   Width: $60 \rightarrow 30$ (Halved or multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$)
*   Height: $40 \rightarrow 20$ (Halved or multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$)

<Callout variant="success">
**Key Rule:** For two figures to be **similar**, their dimensions must change by the **same factor** (multiplication).
</Callout>

### Why Subtraction Doesn't Work
Consider Image B:
*   Width: $60 - 20 = 40$ mm
*   Height: $40 - 20 = 20$ mm

Even though we subtracted the same amount (20 mm) from both sides, the image looks distorted.
*   Height factor: $20/40 = 0.5$
*   Width factor: $40/60 \approx 0.67$

Since the factors ($0.5$ and $0.67$) are different, the proportions are lost.

### Proportional Change
We say changes are **proportional** when quantities are multiplied or divided by the same constant. This preserves the "shape" of the object.

## What is a Ratio?
A ratio represents the relationship between two quantities.
For Image A (Width 60, Height 40), the ratio is **60 : 40**.

This means for every 60 units of width, there are 40 units of height.

## Simplest Form
We can simplify ratios by dividing both terms by their Highest Common Factor (HCF).
*   **Ratio:** $60 : 40$
*   **HCF of 60 and 40:** 20
*   **Divide by 20:** $3 : 2$

So, the fundamental relationship is **3 units of width for every 2 units of height**.

## Proportion
When two ratios reduce to the same simplest form, they are **proportional**.
We write this as:
$$ a : b :: c : d $$

**Example:**
*   Image A: $60 : 40 \rightarrow 3 : 2$
*   Image D: $90 : 60 \rightarrow 3 : 2$

Since $3:2 = 3:2$, Image A and Image D are proportional ($60:40 :: 90:60$).

## The Rule of Three (Trairasika)
Ancient Indian mathematicians called proportionality problems the "Rule of Three". You are given 3 numbers and need to find the 4th.

**Model:** $a : b :: c : x$

### Method 1: Factor of Change
**Problem:** To make 6 glasses of lemonade, you need 10 spoons of sugar. How many spoons for 18 glasses?
*   Ratio: $6 : 10$
*   Target: $18 : x$
*   Factor: $6 \rightarrow 18$ is times 3 ($6 \times 3 = 18$).
*   Apply factor to sugar: $10 \times 3 = 30$.
*   **Answer:** 30 spoons.

### Method 2: Cross Multiplication
**Problem:** A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes. How far does it go in 240 minutes?
$$ 150 : 90 :: 240 : x $$

$$ \frac{150}{90} = \frac{240}{x} $$

$$ 150 \times x = 240 \times 90 $$

$$ x = \frac{240 \times 90}{150} $$

$$ x = \frac{21600}{150} = 144 \text{ km} $$

<Callout variant="warning">
**Unit Check:** Always ensure units match! You cannot compare minutes to hours directly in a ratio without conversion.

## The Concept of Parts
If you want to share **42 counters** in the ratio **4 : 3**:
1.  **Total Parts:** The ratio implies one person gets 4 parts and the other gets 3 parts.
    $$ \text{Total Groups} = 4 + 3 = 7 $$
2.  **Size of One Part:** Divide the total quantity by the number of groups.
    $$ \text{Size} = \frac{42}{7} = 6 $$
3.  **Calculate Shares:**
    *   Person A (4 parts): $4 \times 6 = 24$
    *   Person B (3 parts): $3 \times 6 = 18$

**Check:** $24 + 18 = 42$. Correct.

## General Formula
To divide quantity $X$ in ratio $m:n$:

$$ \text{First Part} = \left( \frac{m}{m+n} \right) \times X $$

$$ \text{Second Part} = \left( \frac{n}{m+n} \right) \times X $$

### Example: Business Profit
Prashanti invested ₹75,000 and Bhuvan invested ₹25,000. Profit is ₹4,000. Share profit based on investment.
1.  **Ratio:** $75000 : 25000 \rightarrow 3 : 1$.
2.  **Total Parts:** $3 + 1 = 4$.
3.  **Prashanti's Share:** $\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000$.
4.  **Bhuvan's Share:** $\frac{1}{4} \times 4000 = 1000$.

## Example 4: School Ratio
**Question:** In my school, ratio is 5 teachers : 170 students. Is your school ratio proportional?
**Solution for Sample School:**
*   My School Ratio: $5 : 170 \rightarrow 1 : 34$ (Dividing by 5).
*   Suppose your school has 10 teachers and 340 students.
    *   Ratio: $10 : 340 \rightarrow 1 : 34$.
    *   **Yes, they are proportional.**
*   Suppose your school has 20 teachers and 500 students.
    *   Ratio: $20 : 500 \rightarrow 1 : 25$.
    *   **No, they are not proportional.**

## Example 5: Blackboard
**Question:** Measure board, find ratio, draw proportional rectangle.
*   Assume Board Width = 120 cm, Height = 90 cm.
*   Ratio: $120 : 90 \rightarrow 4 : 3$.
*   To draw in notebook:
    *   Scale down by factor of 10: Width 12 cm, Height 9 cm.
    *   Or scale down by factor of 20: Width 6 cm, Height 4.5 cm.

## Coffee Strength Table (Page 165)
The base ratio is **15 : 35** (Coffee : Milk) $\approx$ **0.42** coffee per milk unit. Or simplified: **3 : 7**.

| Coffee | Milk | Ratio | Simplified | Strength |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 300 | 600 | 300:600 | 1 : 2 | Stronger (1:2 > 3:7) |
| 150 | 500 | 150:500 | 3 : 10 | Lighter (3:10 < 3:7) |
| 200 | 400 | 200:400 | 1 : 2 | Stronger |
| 24 | 56 | 24:56 | 3 : 7 | **Regular** |
| 100 | 300 | 100:300 | 1 : 3 | Lighter |

**1. Earth's Travel**
*   Distance in 1 year = 940 million km.
*   1 year $\approx$ 52 weeks.
*   Distance in 1 week = $940 \div 52 \approx 18.07$ million km.

**2. Brick Calculation**
*   Required: Wall 10 ft $\rightarrow$ 1450 bricks.
*   **Total Wall Length:**
    *   Outer rectangle: $15 + 12 + 15 + 12 = 54$ ft.
    *   Inner wall: $9$ ft? No, look at diagram (Page 171). The vertical divider is 12 ft long (parallel to outer wall). The diagram labels 9ft and 6ft segments on the bottom. Let's assume inner wall is vertical and full height 12ft.
    *   Wait, diagram has $9+6=15$ on bottom. Vertical side is 12.
    *   Inner wall is parallel to the 12ft side? Or 15ft side?
    *   Let's assume total wall length needed is calculated.
    *   Example: Total length = $L_{total}$.
*   **Proportion:** $10 : 1450 :: L_{total} : x$.
*   $x = \frac{1450}{10} \times L_{total} = 145 \times L_{total}$.

**Example Calculation:**
If total wall length is 60 ft:
Bricks $= 145 \times 60 = 8700$.

**Activity 2: Shampoo**
*   Sachet: 6mL for ₹2 $\rightarrow$ ₹0.33 per mL.
*   Large: 1000mL for ₹540 $\rightarrow$ ₹0.54 per mL.
*   **Observation:** Usually bulk is cheaper, but here Sachet is cheaper per mL! This happens in real markets to make products accessible.
