## What is a Cube?

A cube number is obtained by multiplying a number by itself three times: $n^3 = n \times n \times n$.
Geometrically, it represents the volume of a cube.

## Hardy-Ramanujan Number: 1729

1729 is known as the **Taxicab Number**. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.

$$
\begin{aligned}
1729 &= 12^3 + 1^3 \\
&= 1728 + 1 \\
\\
1729 &= 10^3 + 9^3 \\
&= 1000 + 729
\end{aligned}
$$

## Properties of Cubes

1.  **Parity:** Cube of an even number is even ($2^3 = 8$). Cube of an odd number is odd ($3^3 = 27$).
2.  **Last Digits:**
    *   If a number ends in 1, its cube ends in 1.
    *   If a number ends in 2, its cube ends in 8.
    *   If a number ends in 3, its cube ends in 7.
    *   If a number ends in 4, its cube ends in 4.
    *   If a number ends in 5, its cube ends in 5.
    *   If a number ends in 6, its cube ends in 6.
    *   If a number ends in 7, its cube ends in 3.
    *   If a number ends in 8, its cube ends in 2.
    *   If a number ends in 9, its cube ends in 9.
    *   If a number ends in 0, its cube ends in 0.

<Callout variant="tip">
Notice the pattern: numbers ending in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 keep the same unit digit.
2 flips with 8.
3 flips with 7.
