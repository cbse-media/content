## Question 1
**Which of the following numbers are not perfect squares?**
(i) 2032 (ii) 2048 (iii) 1027 (iv) 1089

**Solution:**
We check the unit digits. A perfect square cannot end in 2, 3, 7, or 8.
*   (i) 2032 ends in **2**. Not a square.
*   (ii) 2048 ends in **8**. Not a square.
*   (iii) 1027 ends in **7**. Not a square.
*   (iv) 1089 ends in 9. It might be a square ($33^2 = 1089$).

**Answer:** (i), (ii), and (iii) are not perfect squares.

## Question 2
**Which one among $64^2, 108^2, 292^2, 36^2$ has last digit 4?**

**Solution:**
The last digit of a square depends on the last digit of the number.
*   $64^2 \to 4 \times 4 = 16$ (ends in 6)
*   $108^2 \to 8 \times 8 = 64$ (**ends in 4**)
*   $292^2 \to 2 \times 2 = 4$ (**ends in 4**)
*   $36^2 \to 6 \times 6 = 36$ (ends in 6)

**Answer:** $108^2$ and $292^2$.

## Question 3
**Given $125^2 = 15625$, what is the value of $126^2$?**

**Solution:**
We can use the identity $(n+1)^2 = n^2 + (n) + (n+1) = n^2 + 2n + 1$.
Here $n = 125$.
$126^2 = 125^2 + 125 + 126$
$126^2 = 15625 + 251$

**Answer:** (iv) $15625 + 251$.

## Question 4
**Find the length of the side of a square whose area is 441 m².**

**Solution:**
Area = Side $\times$ Side = $x^2 = 441$.
We need to find $\sqrt{441}$.
Prime factors of 441:
$441 = 3 \times 147 = 3 \times 3 \times 49 = 3 \times 3 \times 7 \times 7$.
Group pairs: $(3 \times 3) \times (7 \times 7)$.
$\sqrt{441} = 3 \times 7 = 21$.

**Answer:** 21 m.

## Question 5
**Find the smallest square number that is divisible by each of the following numbers: 4, 9, and 10.**

**Solution:**
1.  Find the LCM of 4, 9, 10.
    *   $4 = 2^2$
    *   $9 = 3^2$
    *   $10 = 2 \times 5$
    *   LCM = $2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 4 \times 9 \times 5 = 180$.
2.  Check prime factors of 180: $180 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5$.
3.  To make it a perfect square, all factors must be in pairs.
4.  The factor 5 is unpaired. We must multiply by 5.
5.  $180 \times 5 = 900$.

**Answer:** 900.

## Question 6
**Find the smallest number by which 9408 must be multiplied so that the product is a perfect square. Find the square root of the product.**

**Solution:**
1.  Prime factorization of 9408:
    $9408 \div 2 = 4704$
    $4704 \div 2 = 2352$
    $2352 \div 2 = 1176$
    $1176 \div 2 = 588$
    $588 \div 2 = 294$
    $294 \div 2 = 147$
    $147 \div 3 = 49$
    $49 \div 7 = 7$
    $7 \div 7 = 1$
    Factors: $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 7$.
2.  Group pairs: $(2\times2), (2\times2), (2\times2), (7\times7)$.
3.  The factor **3** is left unpaired.
4.  Smallest number to multiply is **3**.
5.  New number: $9408 \times 3 = 28224$.
6.  Square root = $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 7 \times 3 = 8 \times 21 = 168$.

**Answer:** Multiply by 3. Square root of product is 168.

## Question 7
**How many numbers lie between the squares of the following numbers?**
(i) 16 and 17 (ii) 99 and 100

**Solution:**
Between $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$, there are $2n$ non-square numbers.
(i) Here $n=16$. Numbers = $2 \times 16 = 32$.
(ii) Here $n=99$. Numbers = $2 \times 99 = 198$.

## Question 8
**Fill in the missing numbers:**
$4^2 + 5^2 + 20^2 = (\underline{\quad})^2$
$9^2 + 10^2 + (\underline{\quad})^2 = (\underline{\quad})^2$

**Solution:**
Pattern: $n^2 + (n+1)^2 + [n(n+1)]^2 = [n(n+1)+1]^2$.
1.  $4^2 + 5^2 + 20^2$. Here $4 \times 5 = 20$. Next is 21.
    Answer: **21**
2.  $9^2 + 10^2 + (90)^2$. Next is 91.
    Answer: **90, 91**
