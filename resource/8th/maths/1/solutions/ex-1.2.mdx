## Question 1
**Find the cube roots of 27000 and 10648.**

**Solution:**
1.  **27000:**
    $27000 = 27 \times 1000 = 3^3 \times 10^3$.
    $\sqrt[3]{27000} = 3 \times 10 = 30$.

2.  **10648:**
    Prime factorization:
    $10648 \div 8 = 1331$
    $1331 \div 11 = 121$
    $121 \div 11 = 11$
    Factors: $(2 \times 2 \times 2) \times (11 \times 11 \times 11)$.
    $\sqrt[3]{10648} = 2 \times 11 = 22$.

## Question 2
**What number will you multiply by 1323 to make it a cube number?**

**Solution:**
Prime factorization of 1323:
$1323 \div 3 = 441$
$441 \div 3 = 147$
$147 \div 3 = 49$
$49 = 7 \times 7$
Factors: $(3 \times 3 \times 3) \times 7 \times 7$.
The 3s form a triplet. The 7s are only two ($7 \times 7$). We need one more 7 to complete the triplet.

**Answer:** Multiply by 7.

## Question 3
**State true or false.**
(i) **The cube of any odd number is even.**
    *False.* $3^3 = 27$ (odd).
(ii) **There is no perfect cube that ends with 8.**
    *False.* $2^3 = 8$, $12^3 = 1728$.
(iii) **The cube of a 2-digit number may be a 3-digit number.**
    *False.* Smallest 2-digit number is 10. $10^3 = 1000$ (4 digits).
(iv) **The cube of a 2-digit number may have seven or more digits.**
    *False.* Largest 2-digit number is 99. $99 < 100$. $100^3 = 1,000,000$ (7 digits). So $99^3$ must have fewer than 7 digits (it has 6).
(v) **Cube numbers have an odd number of factors.**
    *False.* Only squares have an odd number of factors. E.g., $8$ has factors 1, 2, 4, 8 (4 factors). Exception: If a number is both a square and a cube (like 64), it has odd factors. But generally, no.

## Question 4
**Guess the cube roots of 4913, 12167, and 32768.**

**Solution:**
*   **4913:** Ends in 3 $\to$ Root ends in 7. Strike out last 3 digits (913). Remaining is 4. Largest cube $<4$ is $1^3=1$.
    Root: **17**.
*   **12167:** Ends in 7 $\to$ Root ends in 3. Strike out 167. Remaining 12. Largest cube $<12$ is $2^3=8$.
    Root: **23**.
*   **32768:** Ends in 8 $\to$ Root ends in 2. Strike out 768. Remaining 32. Largest cube $<32$ is $3^3=27$.
    Root: **32**.

## Question 5
**Which is the greatest? $67^3 - 66^3$, etc.**

**Solution:**
We can use the difference formula approximation or calculate pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = 1 + n(n-1) \times 3$.
*   (i) $67^3 - 66^3 \approx 1 + 67 \times 66 \times 3 \approx 13,000$
*   (ii) $43^3 - 42^3$ is smaller (smaller $n$).
*   (iii) $67^2 - 66^2 = 67 + 66 = 133$. (Much smaller).
*   (iv) $43^2 - 42^2 = 85$.

**Answer:** (i) $67^3 - 66^3$ is the greatest.
