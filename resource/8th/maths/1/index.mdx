## Introduction: The Locker Puzzle

Imagine a secret room with 100 lockers numbered 1 to 100. All lockers are initially closed.
- **Person 1** opens every locker.
- **Person 2** toggles every 2nd locker (closes it if open, opens it if closed).
- **Person 3** toggles every 3rd locker.
- And so on, until **Person 100** toggles the 100th locker.

**Which lockers remain open at the end?**

<Callout variant="tip">
**The Secret:** A locker remains open if it is toggled an **odd number of times**.
The number of times a locker is toggled equals its number of **factors**.
Only **Perfect Squares** (like 1, 4, 9, 16...) have an odd number of factors.
</Callout>

Why? Factors usually come in pairs (e.g., for 12: $1\times12, 2\times6, 3\times4$). But for a perfect square like 36, one factor pairs with itself ($6\times6$), resulting in an odd count of factors ($1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36$).

## Formula Sheet

### 1. Squares ($n^2$)
A square number is the product of a number multiplied by itself.

$$
n^2 = n \times n
$$

| Number ($n$) | Square ($n^2$) | Number ($n$) | Square ($n^2$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | 11 | 121 |
| 2 | 4 | 12 | 144 |
| 3 | 9 | 13 | 169 |
| 4 | 16 | 14 | 196 |
| 5 | 25 | 15 | 225 |
| 6 | 36 | 16 | 256 |
| 7 | 49 | 17 | 289 |
| 8 | 64 | 18 | 324 |
| 9 | 81 | 19 | 361 |
| 10 | 100 | 20 | 400 |

### 2. Cubes ($n^3$)
A cubic number is the product of a number multiplied by itself three times.

$$
n^3 = n \times n \times n
$$

| Number ($n$) | Cube ($n^3$) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 8 |
| 3 | 27 |
| 4 | 64 |
| 5 | 125 |
| 6 | 216 |
| 7 | 343 |
| 8 | 512 |
| 9 | 729 |
| 10 | 1000 |
