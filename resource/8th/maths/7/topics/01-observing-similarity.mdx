## The Digital Image Problem

Imagine you have a picture of a tiger.
*   **Image A (Original):** Width 60 mm, Height 40 mm.
*   **Image C (Resized):** Width 30 mm, Height 20 mm.

Why does Image C look like a smaller version of A, while other resizing attempts look distorted?

### The Mathematical Reason
In Image C, both the width and the height were reduced by the **same factor**.
*   Width: $60 \rightarrow 30$ (Halved or multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$)
*   Height: $40 \rightarrow 20$ (Halved or multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$)

<Callout variant="success">
**Key Rule:** For two figures to be **similar**, their dimensions must change by the **same factor** (multiplication).
</Callout>

### Why Subtraction Doesn't Work
Consider Image B:
*   Width: $60 - 20 = 40$ mm
*   Height: $40 - 20 = 20$ mm

Even though we subtracted the same amount (20 mm) from both sides, the image looks distorted.
*   Height factor: $20/40 = 0.5$
*   Width factor: $40/60 \approx 0.67$

Since the factors ($0.5$ and $0.67$) are different, the proportions are lost.

### Proportional Change
We say changes are **proportional** when quantities are multiplied or divided by the same constant. This preserves the "shape" of the object.
