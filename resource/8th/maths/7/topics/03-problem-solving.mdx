## The Rule of Three (Trairasika)
Ancient Indian mathematicians called proportionality problems the "Rule of Three". You are given 3 numbers and need to find the 4th.

**Model:** $a : b :: c : x$

### Method 1: Factor of Change
**Problem:** To make 6 glasses of lemonade, you need 10 spoons of sugar. How many spoons for 18 glasses?
*   Ratio: $6 : 10$
*   Target: $18 : x$
*   Factor: $6 \rightarrow 18$ is times 3 ($6 \times 3 = 18$).
*   Apply factor to sugar: $10 \times 3 = 30$.
*   **Answer:** 30 spoons.

### Method 2: Cross Multiplication
**Problem:** A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes. How far does it go in 240 minutes?
$$ 150 : 90 :: 240 : x $$

$$ \frac{150}{90} = \frac{240}{x} $$

$$ 150 \times x = 240 \times 90 $$

$$ x = \frac{240 \times 90}{150} $$

$$ x = \frac{21600}{150} = 144 \text{ km} $$

**Unit Check:** Always ensure units match! You cannot compare minutes to hours directly in a ratio without conversion.
