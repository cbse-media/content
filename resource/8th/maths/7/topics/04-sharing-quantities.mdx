## The Concept of Parts
If you want to share **42 counters** in the ratio **4 : 3**:
1.  **Total Parts:** The ratio implies one person gets 4 parts and the other gets 3 parts.
    $$ \text{Total Groups} = 4 + 3 = 7 $$
2.  **Size of One Part:** Divide the total quantity by the number of groups.
    $$ \text{Size} = \frac{42}{7} = 6 $$
3.  **Calculate Shares:**
    *   Person A (4 parts): $4 \times 6 = 24$
    *   Person B (3 parts): $3 \times 6 = 18$

**Check:** $24 + 18 = 42$. Correct.

## General Formula
To divide quantity $X$ in ratio $m:n$:

$$ \text{First Part} = \left( \frac{m}{m+n} \right) \times X $$

$$ \text{Second Part} = \left( \frac{n}{m+n} \right) \times X $$

### Example: Business Profit
Prashanti invested ₹75,000 and Bhuvan invested ₹25,000. Profit is ₹4,000. Share profit based on investment.
1.  **Ratio:** $75000 : 25000 \rightarrow 3 : 1$.
2.  **Total Parts:** $3 + 1 = 4$.
3.  **Prashanti's Share:** $\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000$.
4.  **Bhuvan's Share:** $\frac{1}{4} \times 4000 = 1000$.
