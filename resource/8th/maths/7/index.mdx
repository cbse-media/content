## Introduction

Have you ever resized an image on your computer? Sometimes it looks perfect, but other times it gets distorted—stretched too thin or squashed too wide. Why does this happen? The answer lies in **Proportional Reasoning**.

In this chapter, we explore how changing quantities while keeping their relationship constant allows us to scale images, cook recipes for larger groups, and compare prices effectively.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Ratio ($a : b$)
A ratio compares two quantities. It tells us how much of one thing there is compared to another.
*   **Notation:** $a : b$
*   **Terms:** $a$ and $b$ are called the *terms* of the ratio.
*   **Simplest Form:** Divide both terms by their Highest Common Factor (HCF).

### 2. Proportion ($a : b :: c : d$)
A proportion states that two ratios are equal.
$$ a : b :: c : d \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} $$
*   **Cross Product Property:** If two ratios are proportional, then $ad = bc$.

### 3. Sharing Quantities
To divide a quantity $X$ in the ratio $m : n$:
*   Total parts = $m + n$
*   Part 1 = $\frac{m}{m+n} \times X$
*   Part 2 = $\frac{n}{m+n} \times X$

## Formula Sheet

| Concept | Formula / Rule | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ratio** | $a : b$ | $60 : 40$ simplifies to $3 : 2$ |
| **Proportion** | $a : b :: c : d \implies \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ | $6:10 :: 18:30$ |
| **Cross Multiplication** | If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad = bc$ | Used to find unknown terms. |
| **Factor of Change** | New Value = Old Value $\times$ Factor | Width doubled means factor is 2. |
| **Unitary Method** | Find value of 1 unit first. | Cost of 1 kg = Total Cost / Total Weight |

## Topics Covered
1.  **Similarity in Change:** Observing how images scale without distortion.
2.  **Ratios:** Definition, simplification, and comparison.
3.  **Proportional Reasoning:** Solving "Rule of Three" problems.
4.  **Sharing:** Dividing quantities unevenly based on ratios.
5.  **Unit Conversions:** Essential for comparing ratios with different units.
