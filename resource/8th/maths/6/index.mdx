## Introduction

In this chapter, we bridge the gap between arithmetic and algebra. We start by observing how multiplication behaves when numbers are increased or decreased, leading us to the powerful **Distributive Property**.

This property is the foundation for Algebraic Identities—general formulas that hold true for any value. We will explore these identities not just through symbols, but through **geometric visualizations** (areas of squares and rectangles) and **number patterns**.

## Formula Sheet: Algebraic Identities

**The Distributive Property:**
Multiplication distributes over addition.
$$ a(b + c) = ab + ac $$
</Callout>

### 1. Product of Two Binomials
$$ (a + m)(b + n) = ab + mb + an + mn $$

### 2. Square of a Sum (Identity 1A)
$$ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 $$

### 3. Square of a Difference (Identity 1B)
$$ (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 $$

### 4. Difference of Squares (Identity 1C)
$$ (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 $$
