## Triangular Patterns

Consider a pattern of circles arranged in triangles or squares.
If we examine the number of items in each step, we can often find a quadratic formula ($an^2 + bn + c$).

**Example:**
*   Step 1: 3 items
*   Step 2: 8 items
*   Step 3: 15 items

Let's look at the structure.
*   $3 = 1 \times 3$
*   $8 = 2 \times 4$
*   $15 = 3 \times 5$

The pattern is $k \times (k+2)$.
Expression: $k^2 + 2k$.

## Sum of Squares Pattern

$$ 2(a^2 + b^2) = (a+b)^2 + (a-b)^2 $$

This identity connects the sum of squares to the square of sum and square of difference.

**Verification:**
RHS $= (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) + (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)$
$= 2a^2 + 2b^2$
$= 2(a^2 + b^2)$ = LHS.

**Application:** If you know the sum $(a+b)$ and the difference $(a-b)$, you can easily find the sum of squares without knowing the numbers themselves!
