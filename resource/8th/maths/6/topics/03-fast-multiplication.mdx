## Multiplication by 11

Multiplying by 11 is easy because $11 = 10 + 1$.
$$ N \times 11 = N(10 + 1) = 10N + N $$

**Visual Trick:**
To multiply a number like 3874 by 11:
1.  Write down the last digit (4).
2.  Add pairs of adjacent digits from right to left.
3.  Write down the first digit (plus any carry).

**Example: $3874 \times 11$**
*   Last digit: **4**
*   $7+4 = 11$ (Write **1**, Carry 1)
*   $8+7+1(\text{carry}) = 16$ (Write **6**, Carry 1)
*   $3+8+1(\text{carry}) = 12$ (Write **2**, Carry 1)
*   First digit: $3+1(\text{carry}) = 4$
*   **Result: 42614**

## Using Difference of Squares

Calculate $45 \times 55$.
Notice that these numbers are centered around 50.
$$ 45 = 50 - 5 $$
$$ 55 = 50 + 5 $$

Using Identity 1C:
$$ (50 - 5)(50 + 5) = 50^2 - 5^2 $$
$$ = 2500 - 25 $$
$$ = 2475 $$

## Calculating Squares near Base

Calculate $99^2$.
$$ 99 = 100 - 1 $$
$$ (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2(100)(1) + 1^2 $$
$$ = 10000 - 200 + 1 $$
$$ = 9801 $$
