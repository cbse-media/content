## From Wonder to Investigation

Our journey in science has evolved over the years.
*   **Grade 6:** We started with simple **"Why?"** and **"How?"** questions, driven by wonder.
*   **Grade 7:** We learned that science is **evolving**; answers lead to new questions, and ideas change as we explore deeper.
*   **Grade 8:** We now enter the **Investigative** phase.

### What is Investigation?

Investigation means more than just looking at something. It involves active engagement with the world to solving puzzles.

<Callout variant="info">
**Definition:** Investigation is the process where we ask focused questions, design ways to answer them (experiments), and use observations to refine our understanding.

### The Roots and The Kite

The textbook uses two symbols to represent the scientific mindset:

1.  **The Root:** Represents a deep, solid foundation of knowledge, connecting us to our environment, traditions, and observations.
2.  **The Kite:** Represents curiosity taking flight, allowing ideas to soar toward new horizons.

**Key Takeaway:** Science works best when we balance **observation** (Roots) with **creative thinking** (Kite).

### Why do we Investigate?

We investigate to solve puzzles ranging from everyday life to the mysteries of the universe.
*   *Everyday:* Why does dough rise?
*   *Global:* Is the world getting warmer?
*   *Universal:* How do stars form?

By doing this, you become not just a learner, but a **Young Scientist**.
