## Page 1: Probe and Ponder

These questions are designed to spark curiosity. While they don't have single "exam-style" answers, here are the scientific explanations behind them.

### 1. Why is one side of a puri thinner than the other?

**Scientific Explanation:**
When a rolled dough disk is dropped into hot oil, it submerges. The bottom side contacts the hot oil first.
1.  **Heat Transfer:** The bottom layer gets cooked and stiffens almost immediately.
2.  **Steam Generation:** Water in the dough turns to steam.
3.  **Expansion:** The steam pushes upward. Since the bottom is already slightly stiff, the steam expands the *upper* layer, which is still soft and elastic.
4.  **Result:** The upper layer stretches significantly more than the bottom layer, becoming thinner as it expands like a balloon.

### 2. Are there more grains of sand on all the beaches and deserts of the world, or more stars in our galaxy?

**Scientific Estimate:**
This is a classic "Fermi Problem" (an estimation problem).
*   **Grains of Sand:** Scientists estimate there are roughly $7.5 \times 10^{18}$ (7.5 quintillion) grains of sand on Earth.
*   **Stars in the Universe:** There are approximately $10^{11}$ to $10^{12}$ stars in our galaxy (Milky Way), and there are roughly $2 \times 10^{12}$ galaxies in the observable universe. The total stars are estimated around $10^{22}$ to $10^{24}$.

**Answer:** There are far more stars in the Universe than grains of sand on Earth. However, if we restrict it just to *our galaxy* (The Milky Way), grains of sand might outnumber the stars.

### 3. Why has nature created such a vast variety of plants and animals?

**Scientific Concept:** **Evolution and Adaptation.**
Nature has a vast variety because environments vary (deserts, oceans, forests).
*   Living things possess variations (differences).
*   Those with traits best suited to their specific environment survive and reproduce.
*   Over millions of years, this leads to **Biodiversity**, ensuring life can survive in almost any condition on Earth.

**Your Turn:** The book asks: *"Is there such a question that makes you curious about the world?"*
Try to formulate a question that starts with "Why" or "How" and think about how you could investigate it!
