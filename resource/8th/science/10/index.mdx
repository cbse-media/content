# Light: Mirrors and Lenses

Welcome to the chapter on **Light**. Have you ever wondered why your face looks funny in a shiny spoon? Or why the side-view mirror of a car says objects are closer than they appear? In this chapter, we will explore the science behind these phenomena.

We will move beyond simple plane mirrors and explore **spherical mirrors** (curved mirrors) and **lenses** (transparent curved materials). We will uncover the laws that govern how light reflects and how images are formed.

## Key Concepts Covered

1.  **Spherical Mirrors**: Understanding Concave and Convex mirrors.
2.  **Image Characteristics**: Real vs. Virtual, Erect vs. Inverted, Enlarged vs. Diminished.
3.  **Laws of Reflection**: The rules light follows when it hits a surface.
4.  **Lenses**: How light passes through Convex and Concave lenses.

## Formula Sheet & Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spherical Mirror** | A mirror whose reflecting surface is part of a hollow sphere. |
| **Concave Mirror** | Reflecting surface curves **inwards**. Converges light. |
| **Convex Mirror** | Reflecting surface curves **outwards**. Diverges light. |
| **Incident Ray** | The light ray falling on the surface. |
| **Reflected Ray** | The light ray bouncing back from the surface. |
| **Normal** | A line perpendicular ($90^\circ$) to the surface at the point of incidence. |
| **Angle of Incidence ($i$)** | Angle between the incident ray and the normal. |
| **Angle of Reflection ($r$)** | Angle between the reflected ray and the normal. |
| **Lens** | A transparent material with curved surfaces that refracts light. |

<Callout variant="tip">
**Law of Reflection:**
$$ \angle i = \angle r $$
The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection.
