## Keep the Curiosity Alive (Page 166-169)

### Q1. Incident Angle 40°
**Question:** A light ray is incident on a mirror and gets reflected. The angle made by the incident ray with the normal is 40°. What is the angle made by the reflected ray with the mirror?

**Solution:**
1.  Angle of Incidence ($i$) = $40^\circ$.
2.  According to the Law of Reflection, Angle of Reflection ($r$) = Angle of Incidence ($i$).
3.  So, $r = 40^\circ$.
4.  The question asks for the angle made by the **reflected ray with the mirror**, not the normal.
5.  Angle with mirror = $90^\circ - r$
6.  Angle with mirror = $90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ$.

**Answer:** (ii) 50°

### Q2. Drawing Reflected Rays
**Question:** Draw reflected rays for:
(i) Light falling along the normal.
(ii) Light falling along the normal of a tilted mirror.
(iii) Mirror tilted, light falls at 20° from normal.

**Solution:**
*   **(i) & (ii):** When a light ray falls along the normal, the angle of incidence is $0^\circ$. Therefore, the angle of reflection is also $0^\circ$. The light ray retraces its path (bounces straight back).
*   **(iii):** Since the angle of incidence is $20^\circ$, the reflected ray will also be at $20^\circ$ from the normal on the other side.

### Q3. Identify the Mirror (Sketch Pen Cap)
**Observations:**
*   (i) Image is same size and erect $\rightarrow$ **Plane Mirror**.
*   (ii) Image is erect and diminished (smaller) $\rightarrow$ **Convex Mirror**.
*   (iii) Image is erect and enlarged (larger) $\rightarrow$ **Concave Mirror**.

**Match:**
*   (i) Plane Mirror
*   (ii) Convex Mirror
*   (iii) Concave Mirror

### Q4. Identify the Lens/Glass (Sketch Pen Cap)
**Observations:**
*   (i) No change in size $\rightarrow$ **Flat transparent glass**.
*   (ii) Image is enlarged $\rightarrow$ **Convex Lens**.
*   (iii) Image is diminished $\rightarrow$ **Concave Lens**.

**Match:**
*   (i) Flat transparent glass
*   (ii) Convex Lens
*   (iii) Concave Lens

### Q5. Incidence along Normal
**Question:** When light is incident along the normal, which is true?

**Analysis:**
If the ray lies on the normal line, the angle between the ray and the normal is 0.
So, $\angle i = 0^\circ$.
By law of reflection, $\angle r = 0^\circ$.

**Answer:** (ii) Angle of incidence is 0°.

### Q6. Graph Sheet Reflection
**Observations in Fig 10.25:**
*   Left Mirror: Image is enlarged. This must be a **Concave Mirror**.
*   Middle Mirror: Image is same size. This is a **Plane Mirror**.
*   Right Mirror: Image is smaller (diminished). This is a **Convex Mirror**.

### Q7. Walking towards a Large Convex Mirror
**Question:** A woman walks towards a large convex mirror. What does she see?

**Reasoning:**
A convex mirror **always** forms an erect and diminished image. As an object moves closer to a convex mirror, the image size increases slightly but remains smaller than the object and remains erect.

**Answer:** (iv) her erect image keeps increasing in size (but remains diminished overall compared to reality, just gets bigger than it was when she was far away). *Note: Option (i) says decreasing, which is incorrect as she gets closer. Option (iv) is the most appropriate description of the visual change.*

### Q8. Magnifying Glass
**Question:** What happens when you move a magnifying glass away? Which type of lens is it?

**Solution:**
*   A magnifying glass is a **Convex Lens**.
*   When close to the text, it forms an erect, enlarged image.
*   When moved away, the image eventually flips and becomes inverted (because the object distance becomes greater than the focal length).

### Q9. Match Columns

| Column I | Column II |
| :--- | :--- |
| (i) Concave Mirror | (a) Spherical mirror with reflecting surface curved inwards. |
| (ii) Convex Mirror | (b) Forms an image which is always erect and diminished. |
| (iii) Convex Lens | (c) Object placed behind it may appear inverted at some distance. |
| (iv) Concave Lens | (d) Object placed behind it always appears diminished. |

**Correct Matching:**
*   **(i) Concave Mirror** $\rightarrow$ (a) (Definition)
*   **(ii) Convex Mirror** $\rightarrow$ (b) (Always erect/diminished)
*   **(iii) Convex Lens** $\rightarrow$ (c) (Can invert image if far)
*   **(iv) Concave Lens** $\rightarrow$ (d) (Always diminished)

### Q10. Assertion/Reason (Traffic Mirrors)
**Assertion:** Convex mirrors are preferred for observing traffic behind us.
**Reason:** Convex mirrors provide a significantly larger view area than plane mirrors.

**Analysis:** Both statements are true. The reason correctly explains why they are preferred (the wider field of view allows drivers to see more cars).

**Answer:** (i) Both Assertion and Reason are correct and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.

### Q11. Ray Diagrams (Fig 10.27)
*   **Figure (a):** Rays originate from O, hit M, and reflect as if coming from I. $O$ and $I$ are equidistant. This is a **Plane Mirror**.
*   **Figure (b):** Rays converge to form an image $I$. The mirror curves inward. This is a **Concave Mirror**.

**Answer:** (i) Figure (a) indicates a plane mirror and Figure (b) indicates a concave mirror.

### Q12. Pencil in Water
**Question:** Why does a pencil in a glass of water look bent/changed?

**Answer:**
This is due to **Refraction**. The curved surface of the glass tumbler containing water acts as a **Cylindrical convex lens**. It magnifies the pencil horizontally. Additionally, light bending as it moves from water to air makes the pencil appear displaced.
