## Analyzing Activity 10.7: Solar Concentrator

**Scenario:** You hold a concave mirror facing the sun and focus the light on a paper.

**Physics Involved:**
1.  Sunlight reaches Earth as parallel rays (because the Sun is very far away).
2.  A **Concave Mirror** is a converging mirror.
3.  It reflects these parallel rays to a single point called the **Principal Focus**.
4.  The concentration of many light rays at one tiny point generates intense heat.
5.  This heat is sufficient to reach the ignition temperature of the paper, causing it to burn.

**Why didn't the Convex Mirror work?**
In Activity 10.11, replacing the concave mirror with a convex one failed to burn the paper. This is because a convex mirror **diverges** (spreads out) light. It does not concentrate energy; it scatters it.

## Analyzing Activity 10.8: The Water Drop Lens

**Scenario:** A drop of water on a text makes the letters look bigger.

**Physics Involved:**
1.  Surface Tension pulls the water drop into a curved shape.
2.  The top surface bulges outwards, making it thick in the middle and thin at the edges.
3.  This shape corresponds to a **Convex Lens**.
4.  When the object (text) is very close to a convex lens (closer than its focal length), the lens forms a **Virtual, Erect, and Enlarged** image.
5.  This is the basic principle of a simple microscope or magnifying glass.

## Sample Problem

**Problem:** A shopkeeper wants to install a mirror to watch over his entire large shop from a single point at the cash counter. Which mirror should he choose and why?

**Solution:**
He should choose a **Convex Mirror**.
1.  **Field of View:** Convex mirrors reflect light outwards, allowing them to capture images from a much wider angle than plane or concave mirrors.
2.  **Orientation:** They always produce an **erect** (upright) image. A concave mirror might produce an inverted image if the customer is far away, which would be confusing.
3.  **Conclusion:** Even though the image is smaller (diminished), the ability to see the whole shop erect makes the convex mirror the best choice for surveillance.
