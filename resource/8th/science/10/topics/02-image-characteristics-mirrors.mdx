## Characteristics of Images

When you look into a mirror, the nature of the image can change depending on the mirror type and how far you are from it.

### 1. Concave Mirrors

Concave mirrors are versatile. The image formed depends heavily on the distance of the object.

*   **Object very close:** The image is **Erect** (upright), **Virtual**, and **Enlarged**. (Used in shaving mirrors or dentist mirrors).
*   **Object far away:** The image is **Inverted** (upside down) and can be larger or smaller than the object. It is a **Real** image (can be projected on a screen).

### 2. Convex Mirrors

Convex mirrors are much simpler. No matter where the object is placed:
*   The image is always **Erect** (upright).
*   The image is always **Diminished** (smaller than the object).
*   The image is always **Virtual** (cannot be caught on a screen).

### Summary Table

| Feature | Concave Mirror | Convex Mirror | Plane Mirror |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image Orientation** | Erect (if close) or Inverted (if far) | Always Erect | Always Erect |
| **Image Size** | Enlarged or Diminished | Always Diminished | Same Size |
| **View Area** | Narrow | Wide Field of View | Normal |

## Real-World Applications

### Why are Side-View Mirrors Convex?
Side-view mirrors on vehicles are convex because:
1.  They always produce an **erect** image.
2.  They produce a **diminished** image, allowing a much **wider field of view**. This helps the driver see more traffic behind them.
    > *Note: This is why they carry the warning "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear".*

### Uses of Concave Mirrors
1.  **Dentists:** To see an enlarged image of teeth.
2.  **Torches & Headlights:** The bulb is placed near the mirror to create a powerful parallel beam of light.
3.  **Solar Furnaces:** To concentrate sunlight to a single point to generate heat.

**Real vs. Virtual Images**
*   **Real Image:** Formed when light rays actually meet. Can be captured on a screen (e.g., cinema screen). Always inverted.
*   **Virtual Image:** Formed when light rays *appear* to meet. Cannot be captured on a screen. Always erect.
