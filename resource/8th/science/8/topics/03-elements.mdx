## What is an Element?

An **Element** is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions.
*   **Building Blocks:** Everything in the universe is made of elements.
*   **Atoms:** The smallest particle of an element is an **Atom**.

### Molecules of Elements
Atoms of some elements cannot exist alone. They combine with each other to form **Molecules**.
*   **Hydrogen ($H_2$):** 2 Hydrogen atoms.
*   **Oxygen ($O_2$):** 2 Oxygen atoms.

### Classification of Elements

There are 118 known elements. They are broadly classified as:

1.  **Metals:**
    *   Shiny, malleable, ductile, good conductors.
    *   **Examples:** Gold, Silver, Iron, Copper, Mercury (Liquid).
2.  **Non-Metals:**
    *   Dull, brittle, poor conductors.
    *   **Examples:** Carbon, Sulfur, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Bromine (Liquid).
3.  **Metalloids:**
    *   Properties in between metals and non-metals.
    *   **Examples:** Silicon, Boron.

**Electrolysis of Water:** When electricity is passed through water (with a little acid), it breaks down into two elements: **Hydrogen** and **Oxygen**. This proves water is not an element itself.
