## What is a Mixture?

A **Mixture** is formed when two or more substances are combined physically.
*   **Key Feature:** The components **retain their original properties**. They do *not* react chemically.
*   **Separation:** Can usually be separated by physical methods (filtration, evaporation, magnetic separation).

### Types of Mixtures

1.  **Non-Uniform (Heterogeneous) Mixtures:**
    *   The components are visible with the naked eye.
    *   **Examples:** Sprout salad, Oil and water, Sand and iron filings.

2.  **Uniform (Homogeneous) Mixtures:**
    *   The components are evenly distributed and cannot be seen separately.
    *   **Examples:** Sugar solution, Air, Alloys.

### Special Examples of Mixtures

#### 1. Air
Air is a **uniform mixture** of gases like Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon, Carbon Dioxide, and Water Vapour.
*   **Proof:** We can test for components separately (e.g., Lime water turns milky due to $CO_2$).

#### 2. Alloys
Alloys are uniform mixtures of metals (or metal and non-metal).
*   **Stainless Steel:** Iron + Nickel + Chromium + Carbon.
*   **Brass:** Copper + Zinc.
*   **Bronze:** Copper + Tin.

**Did you know?** Even though alloys look like a single substance, they are mixtures because their components are just mixed physically (melted together) and not chemically bonded in fixed stoichiometric ratios like compounds.
