## What does "Pure" mean?

In daily life, "Pure Milk" means milk without added water or adulterants.
In **Science**, "Pure Milk" is actually a **Mixture** (of water, fats, proteins, sugars).

**Scientific Definition:**
A **Pure Substance** is a form of matter that has **only one type of particle**.
*   It cannot be separated into other kinds of matter by physical processes.
*   It has a fixed composition and distinct properties.

### Classification

Pure substances are divided into two types:
1.  **Elements:** Made of only one type of atom (e.g., Gold, Oxygen).
2.  **Compounds:** Made of two or more types of atoms combined chemically in a fixed ratio (e.g., Water, Salt).

**Thought Experiment:** If you could zoom into a glass of pure water, you would see billions of identical $H_2O$ molecules. If you zoomed into a gold ring, you would see billions of identical Gold ($Au$) atoms.
