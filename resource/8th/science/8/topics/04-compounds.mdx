## What is a Compound?

A **Compound** is a pure substance formed when two or more elements combine **chemically** in a **fixed ratio**.

### Key Characteristics

1.  **Fixed Composition:** Water ($H_2O$) is always 2 Hydrogen atoms : 1 Oxygen atom. If the ratio changes, it becomes a different substance (like $H_2O_2$).
2.  **New Properties:** The properties of a compound are completely different from its constituent elements.
    *   **Hydrogen:** Explosive gas.
    *   **Oxygen:** Supports combustion (burning).
    *   **Water ($H_2O$):** Extinguishes fire!

3.  **Separation:** Constituents can only be separated by **chemical methods** (like electrolysis), not physical methods (like filtration).

### Common Examples

| Compound | Elements Present | Chemical Formula |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Water | Hydrogen, Oxygen | $H_2O$ |
| Common Salt | Sodium, Chlorine | $NaCl$ |
| Sugar | Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen | $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$ |
| Carbon Dioxide | Carbon, Oxygen | $CO_2$ |

### Activity: Heating Sugar
When you heat sugar in a test tube:
1.  It turns brown, then black (chars).
2.  Water droplets appear on the sides.
3.  **Result:** Sugar decomposes into **Carbon** (black residue) and **Water**. This proves Sugar is a compound.
