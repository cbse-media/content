## 1. Separation Challenge

How would you separate the following mixtures?

| Mixture | Method | Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Salt and Water** | Evaporation | Water evaporates, salt is left behind. |
| **Sand and Water** | Filtration | Sand is insoluble and stays on filter paper. |
| **Iron filings and Sand** | Magnetic Separation | Iron is magnetic, sand is not. |
| **Oil and Water** | Separating Funnel | Oil is less dense and floats on water. |

## 2. Identify the Mistake

**Student Statement:** "I made a compound by mixing salt and sugar in a bowl."
**Correction:** Salt and sugar mixed in a bowl is a **Mixture**, not a compound.
*   **Reason 1:** No chemical reaction took place (no heat/light/new substance).
*   **Reason 2:** You can still separate them (though difficult, technically possible by solubility differences in alcohol).
*   **Reason 3:** They retain their individual tastes.

## 3. Diagrams

**Draw the particle arrangement for:**
1.  **Pure Element (Helium gas):** Single atoms far apart.
2.  **Pure Compound (CO2 gas):** Molecules (1 Carbon + 2 Oxygen) far apart.
3.  **Mixture (Air):** A mix of single atoms (Argon), diatomic molecules ($N_2, O_2$), and compound molecules ($CO_2, H_2O$) floating together.
