## Introduction

Look around you. The air you breathe, the water you drink, and the food you eat are all forms of **Matter**. But are they all the same?

In this chapter, we explore how matter is classified into three main categories based on its composition: **Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures**. We will learn how to distinguish between them using scientific experiments and understand their unique properties.

### Chapter Roadmap

*   **Topic 1:** [Mixtures](/topics/01-mixtures) (Uniform vs Non-uniform, Alloys, Air)
*   **Topic 2:** [Pure Substances](/topics/02-pure-substances) (Definition of purity in science)
*   **Topic 3:** [Elements](/topics/03-elements) (Metals, Non-metals, Atoms)
*   **Topic 4:** [Compounds](/topics/04-compounds) (Formation, Properties vs Constituents)
*   **Topic 5:** [Iron & Sulfur Experiment](/topics/05-iron-sulfur-experiment) (Distinguishing Mixtures from Compounds)

### Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pure Substance** | Matter made up of only one type of particle (atoms or molecules). Cannot be separated by physical methods. |
| **Mixture** | Formed when two or more substances are mixed together without any chemical reaction. Components retain their properties. |
| **Element** | A pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Building blocks of matter (e.g., Gold, Oxygen). |
| **Compound** | A pure substance formed when two or more elements combine chemically in a fixed ratio (e.g., Water, Salt). |
| **Atom** | The smallest particle of an element. |
| **Molecule** | A group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. |
