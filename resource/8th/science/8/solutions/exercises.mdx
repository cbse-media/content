## Questions and Answers

### 1. Reaction A + B -> C
**Question:** A and B cannot be broken down simpler. Which statement is correct?
*   A and B are **Elements** (since they can't be broken down).
*   C is formed from A and B chemically, so C is a **Compound**.
*   Compounds have a fixed composition.
**Answer:** (iv) **A and B are elements, C is a compound, and has a fixed composition.**

### 2. Assertion-Reason: Air is a Mixture
*   **Assertion:** Air is a mixture. (True)
*   **Reason:** A mixture is formed when two or more substances are mixed without chemical change. (True)
*   **Link:** Does the reason explain why air is a mixture? Yes, because air is formed by mixing gases without them reacting chemically.
**Answer:** (i) **Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation.**

### 3. Properties of Water vs Elements
**Statement:** Water, a compound, has different properties compared to Oxygen and Hydrogen. Justify.
**Justification:**
1.  **State:** Hydrogen and Oxygen are gases; Water is a liquid.
2.  **Combustibility:** Hydrogen burns with a pop sound (fuel). Oxygen supports burning. Water puts out fire.
3.  **Composition:** Hydrogen and Oxygen are elements. Water is a compound ($H_2O$).

### 4. Matching Examples
*   (i) Elements - water (Compound) -> Incorrect.
*   (ii) Uniform mixtures - minerals, seawater, bronze, air. -> **Correct.** (Minerals can be compounds or mixtures, but often uniform. Seawater, bronze, air are uniform).
*   (iii) Pure substances - Sugar (Compound), Iron (Element), Oxygen (Element). -> Correct.
*   (iv) Non-uniform - Air (Uniform) -> Incorrect.
**Answer:** (iii) **Pure substances— carbon dioxide, iron, oxygen, sugar.**
*(ii) is also largely correct depending on the mineral definition, but (iii) is definitively chemically correct.*

### 5. Iron Oxide and Magnesium Oxide Reactions
*   **Iron (Element)** + **Oxygen/Moisture (Mixture)** $\rightarrow$ **Rust/Iron Oxide (Compound)**.
*   **Magnesium (Element)** + **Oxygen (Element)** $\rightarrow$ **Magnesium Oxide (Compound)**.
**Justification:** Elements cannot be broken down. Compounds are formed by chemical combination. Air is a mixture of gases.

### 6. Classification Table

| **Elements** | **Compounds** | **Mixtures** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aluminium | Carbon dioxide | Sand |
| Gold | Magnesium oxide | Seawater |
| Oxygen | Rust ($Fe_2O_3$) | Muddy water |
| Sulfur | Iron sulfide | Air |
| Nitrogen | Glucose | Fruit Juice |
| Hydrogen | Water | |
| | Sodium chloride | |
| | Baking soda | |

**Pure Substances:** All Elements + All Compounds listed above.

### 7. Heating Iron and Sulfur
*   **Substance Formed:** Iron Sulfide ($FeS$).
*   **Difference:** It is a black solid, non-magnetic, and properties are different from iron or sulfur.
*   **Equation:** Iron + Sulfur $\xrightarrow{\text{Heat}}$ Iron Sulfide.

### 8. Element AND Compound?
**Answer:** **No.**
A substance is either an Element (one type of atom) or a Compound (different atoms bonded). It cannot be both. However, both are **Pure Substances**.

### 9. Water as a Mixture?
If water were a mixture of H and O:
1.  It would be a gas (mixture of two gases).
2.  Lighting a match near "water" would cause an explosion (Hydrogen burns!).
3.  Life as we know it would not exist because liquid water is essential for biological processes.

### 10. Fig 8.24 Analysis (Gas A)
*   **Reaction:** Iron + Dilute HCl $\rightarrow$ Iron Chloride + **Hydrogen Gas**.
*   **Gas A:** Hydrogen.
*   **Word Equation:** Iron + Hydrochloric Acid $\rightarrow$ Iron Chloride + Hydrogen.

### 11. Compounds from Non-metals
1.  **Water ($H_2O$):** Drinking, Washing.
2.  **Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$):** Photosynthesis, Fire Extinguishers, Carbonated Drinks.

### 12. Gold: Mineral and Metal?
*   **Metal:** Chemically, Gold ($Au$) is a metal (shiny, conductor).
*   **Mineral:** Geologically, it is found naturally in the earth's crust in its native form (Native Gold). Since minerals are naturally occurring solid substances, native Gold is considered a mineral.
