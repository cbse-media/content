**Q1: Which of the entities in the picture consist of matter, and which do not?**
*   **Matter:** Students, trees, buildings, football, books, water bottles, air, clothes. (Anything with mass and volume).
*   **Not Matter:** Sunlight, shadows, heat, thoughts, sound, gravity.

**Q2: How can elements be combined to form a compound?**
**Answer:** Elements combine to form a compound through a **chemical reaction**. This usually involves energy changes (like heating, applying electricity, or burning), where atoms of different elements bond together in a fixed ratio.

**Q3: How could the discovery of a compound that absorbs carbon dioxide from the air contribute to solving environmental challenges?**
**Answer:** Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) is a major greenhouse gas causing global warming. If we discover or create a compound that efficiently absorbs $CO_2$ from the atmosphere (Carbon Capture technology), we could significantly reduce the greenhouse effect and combat climate change.
