## 1. Earth Survival Kit
**Task:** Build a model of Earth essentials for another planet.
**Components:**
*   **Biosphere Jar:** Plants for Oxygen.
*   **Water Recycler:** To clean water.
*   **Solar Shield:** To block radiation.
*   **Heater/Cooler:** To maintain 'Goldilocks' temperature.

## 2. Moon Soil Experiment (Chandrayaan-4)
**Hypothesis:** Can plants grow in Moon soil (Regolith)?
**Experiment:**
*   Take Moon soil simulant (available in labs).
*   Add nutrients (since Moon soil lacks organic matter/bacteria).
*   Add water and light.
*   **Prediction:** Plants might sprout but struggle without the help of soil bacteria to fix nitrogen.

## 3. Why so many eggs?
**Observation:** Fish/Frogs lay thousands of eggs; Humans have 1 baby.
**Reasoning:**
*   **External Fertilization:** Eggs laid in water are eaten by predators or destroyed by currents.
*   **Strategy:** Laying thousands ensures that *at least a few* survive to adulthood.
*   **Mammals:** Invest energy in protecting *one* baby inside the body, ensuring a high survival rate.

## 4. Parental Care
*   **Birds:** High parental care $\rightarrow$ Higher survival rate of individual chicks $\rightarrow$ Fewer eggs needed.
*   **Reptiles:** Low/No parental care $\rightarrow$ Lower survival rate $\rightarrow$ Must lay more eggs to compensate.

**Final Thought: It's Never the End**
Science is a journey. The questions you asked in this chapter—about Mars, eggs, or soil—are the seeds of future discoveries. Keep asking, keep observing. The universe is waiting for you!
