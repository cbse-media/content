## Keep the Curiosity Alive (Page 226-227)

### Q1. Why Mars cannot support life currently?
**Answer:** (iii) It lacks a thick atmosphere and liquid water.
*Explanation:* While Mars is in the habitable zone edge, its atmosphere is too thin to trap heat or allow liquid water to remain stable on the surface.

### Q2. Example of Geodiversity
**Answer:** (ii) Different landforms like mountains, valleys, and deserts.
*Explanation:* Geodiversity refers to the variety of earth materials and forms (rocks, soil, landforms).

### Q3. Smaller Earth Atmosphere
**Answer:** (ii) It would escape into space due to weaker gravity.
*Explanation:* Gravity is determined by mass. A smaller/lighter Earth would have less gravity, unable to hold onto gas molecules.

### Q4. Variation in Sexual Reproduction
**Answer:** (iv) They get mixed instructions (genes) from both parents.
*Explanation:* Sexual reproduction combines genetic material from two sources, creating unique combinations.

### Q5. Plants in Wall Cracks
**Answer:**
*   **Source:** Seeds likely arrived via wind or bird droppings (birds eat fruit and excrete seeds).
*   **Conditions:** The crack trapped a small amount of soil/dust and moisture (from monsoon rain), allowing the seed to germinate.

### Q6. Deforestation Effects
**Answer:**
*   **Climate:** Trees release water vapor (transpiration). Cutting them reduces local humidity and rainfall, potentially making the area hotter (Urban Heat Island effect).
*   **Biodiversity:** Habitat loss leads to animals/birds leaving or dying.
*   **Water:** Tree roots hold soil and help groundwater recharge. Without them, rainwater runs off causing floods and soil erosion, reducing groundwater availability.

### Q7. "Climate Change is Nothing New"
**Response:**
"While Earth has changed in the past, current global warming is happening **much faster** due to human activities (burning fossil fuels). Natural cycles take thousands of years; we are seeing changes in decades. This rapid change doesn't give life enough time to adapt."

### Q8. Magnetic Field Disappearance
**Answer:**
If the magnetic field vanished:
1.  **Radiation:** Harmful solar wind and cosmic rays would bombard the surface, causing cancer and DNA damage.
2.  **Atmosphere Loss:** The solar wind would slowly strip away the atmosphere (like it likely did on Mars).
3.  **Navigation:** Animals that use magnetic fields to migrate (birds, turtles) would get lost.

### Q9. Mars Settlement Design
**Three Essentials:**
1.  **Oxygen/Air Supply:** Mars has no breathable air.
2.  **Liquid Water:** Must be extracted from ice or recycled.
3.  **Shielding:** Protection from radiation (since Mars has no magnetic field/thick atmosphere).
**Hardest to Replicate:** A breathable atmosphere/Shielding on a planetary scale. We can build domes, but terraforming the whole planet is currently impossible.

### Q10. Village Climate Adaptation
**Causes:** Deforestation or Global Climate Change.
**Adaptations:**
1.  **Rainwater Harvesting:** To store water during unpredictable rain.
2.  **Crop Diversification:** Planting heat-resistant or drought-resistant crops.

### Q11. No Atmosphere?
**Answer:**
1.  **Temperature:** Extreme swings (Boiling day, Freezing night).
2.  **Water:** Would boil away into space immediately.
3.  **Life:** Impossible (No oxygen, no pressure, deadly radiation).

### Q12. Vegetative Propagation Examples
1.  **Potato:** Grows from "eyes".
2.  **Ginger/Turmeric:** Grows from rhizomes.
3.  **Rose/Hibiscus:** Grows from stem cuttings.
4.  **Bryophyllum:** Grows from leaf buds.
5.  **Strawberry:** Grows from runners.
