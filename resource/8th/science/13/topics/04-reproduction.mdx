## What Keeps Life Going?

If organisms didn't reproduce, life would vanish. Reproduction ensures continuity. It involves passing **Genetic Material (Genes)** from parents to offspring.

### Types of Reproduction

There are two main methods:

1.  **Asexual Reproduction:**
    *   **Single Parent.**
    *   Offspring are exact copies (Clones).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Vegetative Propagation:** Growing plants from stems (Rose, Sugarcane), eyes (Potato), or rhizomes (Ginger).
        *   **Binary Fission:** Bacteria/Amoeba splitting in two.
        *   **Budding:** Hydra growing tiny buds.
        *   **Regeneration:** Planaria regrowing from a cut piece.

2.  **Sexual Reproduction:**
    *   **Two Parents** (Male and Female).
    *   Involves specialized cells called **Gametes** (Sperm and Egg).
    *   Offspring inherit a mix of traits from both parents (Variation).
    *   **Process:**
        $$ \text{Male Gamete} + \text{Female Gamete} \xrightarrow{\text{Fertilisation}} \text{Zygote} \rightarrow \text{Embryo} \rightarrow \text{Baby} $$

### Reproduction in Plants vs. Animals

| Feature | Plants | Animals |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Male Gamete** | Pollen (in Anther) | Sperm |
| **Female Gamete** | Ovule (in Flower) | Egg (Ovum) |
| **Process** | Pollination $\rightarrow$ Fertilisation | Mating $\rightarrow$ Fertilisation |
| **Outcome** | Seed (inside Fruit) | Baby (Egg or Live Birth) |

**Egg Layers vs. Live Births**
*   **Oviparous:** Animals that lay eggs (Birds, Reptiles, Fish). The embryo develops *outside* the mother's body using yolk for food.
*   **Viviparous:** Animals that give birth to live young (Mammals, Humans). The embryo develops *inside* the mother's body, getting food/oxygen from her.

### Why Variation Matters
Sexual reproduction creates small differences (variations). Over millions of years, these small changes allow species to adapt to new environments (e.g., Camels developing humps).
