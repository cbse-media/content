## The Triple Planetary Crisis

Human activities are disturbing the delicate balance of Earth. We face three major interconnected challenges:

### 1. Climate Change
*   **Cause:** Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil) releases excess Greenhouse Gases ($CO_2$, Methane).
*   **Effect:** Global Warming.
*   **Consequences:** Melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather (floods, droughts).

### 2. Pollution
*   **Air:** Smog, Acid Rain (from factory smoke and vehicles).
*   **Water:** Plastic waste, chemical runoff harming aquatic life.
*   **Soil:** Excess fertilizers/pesticides killing soil microbes.

### 3. Biodiversity Loss
*   **Habitat Destruction:** Cutting forests destroys homes for animals.
*   **Invasive Species:** New species taking over ecosystems.
*   **Result:** Extinction of species weakens the food web.

## Global Action
Countries have signed agreements to protect Earth:
*   **Montreal Protocol (1987):** To protect the Ozone Layer by banning CFCs.
*   **Paris Agreement (2015):** To limit global warming to below 1.5°C.

**What can YOU do?**
*   **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.**
*   Save water and electricity.
