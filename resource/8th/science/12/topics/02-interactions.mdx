## Relationships Between Organisms

In an ecosystem, no organism lives alone. They interact in various ways to survive, find food, or reproduce.

### 1. Feeding Relationships
The most basic interaction is "Who eats whom?"
*   **Predation**: One organism (Predator) hunts and eats another (Prey). Example: Tiger eats Deer.

### 2. Competition
When resources like food, water, or space are limited, organisms fight for them.
*   **Intraspecific Competition**: Between members of the same species (two deer fighting for grass).
*   **Interspecific Competition**: Between different species (lions and hyenas fighting for the same kill).
*   **Balance**: Competition controls population size and prevents any single species from taking over.

### 3. Symbiosis (Living Together)
Some interactions involve close, long-term relationships between different species.

| Type | Definition | Effect on Species A | Effect on Species B | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mutualism** | Both benefit. | Happy (+)| Happy (+) | **Honeybees & Flowers** (Bees get nectar, Flowers get pollinated). |
| **Commensalism** | One benefits, the other is unaffected. | Happy (+) | Neutral (0) | **Orchids on Trees** (Orchids get sunlight/support, Tree is unharmed). |
| **Parasitism** | One benefits, the other is harmed. | Happy (+) | Sad (-) | **Ticks on Dogs** (Ticks suck blood, Dog gets irritation/disease). |

**The Case of the Pond (Activity 12.3)**
Scientists found that ponds **with fish** had more seeds produced by nearby plants than ponds **without fish**. Why?
1.  Fish eat dragonfly larvae.
2.  Fewer dragonflies mean fewer predators for bees and butterflies.
3.  More bees/butterflies survive to **pollinate** the nearby flowers.
4.  More pollination = More seeds.
*This shows how connected nature is!*
