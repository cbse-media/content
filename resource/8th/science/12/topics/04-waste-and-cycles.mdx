## What Happens to Dead Things?

Nature creates zero waste. When plants and animals die, they don't just pile up. They are cleaned up by a special group of organisms.

### Decomposers (Saprotrophs)
These include **Fungi** (like mushrooms) and **Bacteria**.
*   **Action:** They break down complex dead organic matter into simple substances.
*   **Result:** Nutrients are released back into the soil.
*   **Cycle:** Plants use these recycled nutrients from the soil to grow again.

**The Cycle of Life:**
1.  **Producers** take nutrients from soil.
2.  **Consumers** eat producers.
3.  Producers and Consumers die.
4.  **Decomposers** break them down.
5.  Nutrients return to soil.

**Scavengers vs. Decomposers**
*   **Scavengers** (like Vultures, Crows, Hyenas) eat dead animals *chunks* and clean the environment visibly.
*   **Decomposers** break down the remains at a *microscopic* level chemically.

### Importance of Decomposers
Without decomposers:
1.  Dead bodies and waste would pile up forever.
2.  The soil would run out of nutrients.
3.  New plants would not be able to grow.
