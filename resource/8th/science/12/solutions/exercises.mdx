## Keep the Curiosity Alive (Page 207-208)

### Q1. Diagram Analysis
**Question:** Refer to the diagram (concentric circles of Population -> Community -> Ecosystem) and select the **wrong** statement.
*   (i) A community is larger than a population. (Correct)
*   (ii) A community is smaller than an ecosystem. (Correct)
*   (iii) An ecosystem is part of a community. (**Incorrect**)

**Answer:** **(iii)**.
*Explanation:* An ecosystem includes the community *plus* the abiotic factors. Therefore, the community is a part of the ecosystem, not the other way around.

### Q2. Disappearance of Decomposers
**Question:** If all decomposers disappear from a forest, what would happen?
**Answer:**
1.  **Waste Pile-up:** Dead plants, leaves, and animal bodies would accumulate and not decay.
2.  **Nutrient Depletion:** The nutrients locked inside dead bodies would never return to the soil.
3.  **Plant Death:** Plants would eventually die due to a lack of nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus) in the soil.
4.  **Ecosystem Collapse:** Without plants, herbivores and carnivores would also die.

### Q3. Mangroves and Tsunami
**Question:** Why was Selvam's village less affected by the Tsunami due to mangroves?
**Answer:**
Mangrove forests have dense, tangled root systems that grow above the soil. These roots act as a **physical barrier**.
1.  **Shock Absorbers:** They break the force of giant waves (like tsunamis) and strong winds.
2.  **Soil Anchor:** They hold the soil tightly, preventing the land from being washed away.

### Q4. Food Chain Disruption
**Chain:** Grass $\rightarrow$ Grasshopper $\rightarrow$ Frog $\rightarrow$ Snake
**Question:** If frogs disappear, what happens to grasshoppers and snakes?
**Answer:**
1.  **Grasshoppers (Prey):** Their population will **increase** rapidly because there is no predator (frog) to eat them. This might lead to overgrazing of the grass.
2.  **Snakes (Predator):** Their population will **decrease** because they have lost their food source (frogs). They might starve or have to migrate.

### Q5. Fewer Butterflies
**Question:** Why are there fewer butterflies in the school garden?
**Possible Reasons:**
1.  **Lack of Flowers:** Fewer nectar-producing plants.
2.  **Pesticides:** Use of chemicals in the garden killing caterpillars.
3.  **Habitat Loss:** Removal of specific host plants where butterflies lay eggs.
**Steps to take:**
*   Plant more flowering plants.
*   Stop using chemical pesticides.
*   Provide water sources (puddles for mud-puddling).

### Q6. Producers Only?
**Question:** Why can't an ecosystem exist with only producers?
**Answer:**
An ecosystem needs recycling.
1.  If there are only producers, they will eventually die.
2.  Without **consumers** (to keep population in check) and **decomposers** (to recycle dead matter), the dead plants would pile up.
3.  The soil would run out of nutrients, and the producers would eventually die out.

### Q7. Comparing Two Places
**Example:**
*   **Place A (Park):** Trees, grass, birds, squirrels (Biotic) + Soil, benches, fountain (Abiotic). Managed by humans.
*   **Place B (Roadside):** Weeds, stray dogs, ants (Biotic) + Tarmac, dust, exhaust fumes (Abiotic). Harsh environment.
**Difference:** The park has higher biodiversity and better conditions for growth than the roadside.

### Q8. Sustainable Fields
**Comment:** "Human-made ecosystems like agricultural fields are necessary, but they must be made sustainable."
**Answer:**
Agricultural fields are monocultures (growing one crop). They are unstable compared to natural forests. To make them sustainable:
*   Use organic fertilizers instead of chemicals.
*   Practice crop rotation to save soil health.
*   Plant trees around the farm (agroforestry) to support birds and insects that control pests.

### Q9. Hare Population Drop
**Chain:** Grass $\rightarrow$ Hare $\rightarrow$ Fox/Eagle
**Question:** If Hares die of disease...
**Answer:**
1.  **Grass (Producer):** Will **increase** (less grazing).
2.  **Fox/Eagle (Predators):** Will **decrease** due to lack of food. They might start hunting other animals (like mice) more aggressively, affecting those populations too.
