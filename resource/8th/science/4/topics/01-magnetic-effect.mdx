## Oersted's Discovery

In 1820, a Danish scientist named **Hans Christian Oersted** noticed something strange. When he switched on an electric circuit, a compass needle lying nearby moved!

*   **Observation:** A compass needle deflects when placed near a current-carrying wire.
*   **Conclusion:** Electric current produces a **magnetic field** around it.

## Electromagnets

We can use this effect to create temporary magnets called **electromagnets**.

### How to make one?
1.  Take a magnetic material (like an iron nail).
2.  Wind an insulated copper wire tightly around it in a coil.
3.  Connect the wire ends to a battery.

When current flows, the nail behaves like a strong magnet and can attract paper clips. When the current stops, it loses its magnetism.

### Polarity of an Electromagnet
An electromagnet has a **North Pole** and a **South Pole**, just like a bar magnet.
*   If the compass North pole is attracted to End A, then End A is the **South Pole** (unlike poles attract).
*   If you reverse the direction of current (swap battery terminals), the poles of the electromagnet also reverse.

### Factors Affecting Strength
The strength of an electromagnet depends on:
1.  **Current Strength:** More cells (batteries) $\rightarrow$ Stronger magnet.
2.  **Number of Turns:** More turns in the coil $\rightarrow$ Stronger magnet.
3.  **Core Material:** Using soft iron as a core makes it much stronger than air or wood.

**Real World Use:** Giant electromagnets attached to cranes are used in scrap yards to lift heavy iron loads and separate magnetic metals from waste.
