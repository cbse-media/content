## Page 1: Probe and Ponder

**Q1: Why does it feel harder to pedal a bicycle when going uphill than on flat ground?**
**Answer:** On flat ground, you primarily work against friction and air resistance. When going uphill, you must also work against the **Force of Gravity** which is pulling you downwards/backwards. You need to apply more muscular force to overcome this additional pull.

**Q2: Why is it easier to slip on a wet surface?**
**Answer:** Friction arises from the interlocking of irregularities between two surfaces. Water fills these irregularities and forms a smooth layer between your feet and the floor. This significantly **reduces friction**, making it hard to grip the floor, leading to slipping.

**Q3: Why do we feel ‘light’ or like we are ‘floating’ just after our swing reaches its highest point and begins to come down?**
**Answer:** At the highest point, the swing momentarily stops before falling back. As you start descending, you are in a state of "free fall" for a split second where the support force from the seat reduces. This creates a sensation of weightlessness.
