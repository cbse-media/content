## Questions and Answers

### 1. Match Items (Column A to Column B)

| Type of Force | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **(i) Muscular force** | **(b)** A child lifting a school bag. |
| **(ii) Magnetic force** | **(e)** A compass needle pointing North. |
| **(iii) Frictional force** | **(a)** A cricket ball stopping on its own. |
| **(iv) Gravitational force** | **(c)** A fruit falling from a tree. |
| **(v) Electrostatic force** | **(d)** Balloon rubbed on woollen cloth attracting hair. |

### 2. True or False

(i) A force is always required to change the speed of motion of an object.
**Answer: True.** (Newton's First Law: An object stays in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force).

(ii) Due to friction, the speed of the ball rolling on a flat ground increases.
**Answer: False.** (Friction *opposes* motion, so the speed decreases).

(iii) There is no force between two charged objects placed at a small distance apart.
**Answer: False.** (Electrostatic force is a non-contact force; they will attract or repel even at a distance).

### 3. Charged Balloons
**Question:** Two balloons rubbed with a woollen cloth are brought near each other. What happens?
**Answer:** They will **repel** each other.
*   *Reason:* Rubbing both balloons with the same material (wool) gives them the **same type of charge** (e.g., both negative). Like charges repel each other.

### 4. Sinking Coin vs. Floating Wood
**Question:** Why does a coin sink but a big wooden block float?
**Answer:** This depends on **Density** and **Buoyancy**.
*   The coin is denser than water. The upthrust (buoyant force) provided by the water is *less* than the coin's weight, so it sinks.
*   The wooden block is less dense than water. It displaces enough water to create an upthrust *equal* to its weight, so it floats.

### 5. Ball Thrown Upwards
**(i) During upward motion:**
*   **Forces:** Gravity (Downwards), Air Friction (Downwards).
*   **Result:** Speed decreases.

**(ii) During downward motion:**
*   **Forces:** Gravity (Downwards), Air Friction (Upwards - opposing motion).
*   **Result:** Speed increases.

**(iii) At topmost position:**
*   **Forces:** Gravity is still acting downwards. Even though velocity is zero for an instant, the force of gravity never stops.

### 6. Ball on Inclined Plane (Diagram Analysis)

The ball starts at P, goes down, and stops at A due to friction on the horizontal surface.

**(i) How to stop BEFORE point A?**
*   **Increase Friction:** Make the horizontal surface rougher (e.g., spread sand or carpet).
*   **Lower Height P:** Release the ball from a lower height so it has less energy.

**(ii) How to stop AFTER crossing point A?**
*   **Decrease Friction:** Make the surface smoother (e.g., apply oil, use glass or ice).
*   **Increase Height P:** Release the ball from a higher point.

### 7. Slipping on Smooth Surfaces
**Answer:** We walk by pushing the ground backward; friction pushes us forward (action-reaction). On smooth surfaces (ice/polish), the force of friction is extremely low. Without sufficient friction to grip our feet, we cannot push effectively, leading to a slip.

### 8. Non-uniform Motion
**Answer:** **Yes.** Non-uniform motion means the speed or direction is changing. According to physics, any change in speed or direction requires an unbalanced **external force**.

### 9. Weight on Moon
**Answer:**
*   **Cause:** The Moon has less mass than Earth, so its gravitational pull is weaker (approx 1/6th of Earth's). Hence, Weight ($W=mg$) decreases.
*   **Mass:** No, the mass does **not** change. Mass is the amount of matter in the object, which remains constant regardless of location.

### 10. Floating Objects Depth (Fig 5.17)
*   Object 1 dips very little (Floats high).
*   Object 2 dips halfway.
*   Object 3 dips almost completely (Floats low).

**Analysis:**
To float, Upthrust must equal Weight ($U = W$). Upthrust depends on the volume submerged.
*   Object 3 is submerged the most $\rightarrow$ It needs the most upthrust to balance its weight $\rightarrow$ It is the heaviest.
*   Object 1 is submerged the least $\rightarrow$ It is the lightest.

**Correct Option:** (iv) $w_3 > w_2 > w_1$ (Note: The question options in the text might have typos, but logically, deepest sinker = heaviest among same-sized floating objects). *Checking options provided in PDF:*
(i) Equal
(ii) $w_1 > w_2 > w_3$
(iii) $w_2 > w_3 > w_1$
(iv) $w_3 > w_1 > w_2$ (This implies 3 is heaviest, then 1, then 2. Wait, looking at diagram 5.17:
    *   1 is barely in water.
    *   2 is somewhat in.
    *   3 is mostly in.
    *   Therefore $Weight_3 > Weight_2 > Weight_1$.
    *   None of the provided options exactly match $3 > 2 > 1$.
    *   Let's re-read the options carefully.
    *   (iv) says $w_3 > w_1 > w_2$. This claims 1 is heavier than 2. But 1 is floating higher than 2.
    *   **Correction:** Let's look at the diagram again. 1 is high, 2 is middle, 3 is low. Weight corresponds to submerged volume. So $W_3 > W_2 > W_1$.
    *   If the options in the book are rigid, there may be a typo in the book or my reading of the diagram depth. Assuming standard physics: Deepest = Heaviest.
