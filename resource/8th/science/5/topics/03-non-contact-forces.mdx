## What are Non-Contact Forces?

These forces can exert a push or pull even from a distance, without touching the object.

### 1. Magnetic Force
A magnet can attract iron objects or repel other magnets without touching them.
*   **Attraction:** Unlike poles (North-South) pull each other.
*   **Repulsion:** Like poles (North-North) push each other away.

### 2. Electrostatic Force
The force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body.
*   **Experiment:** Rub a plastic straw with paper/polythene. It acquires an **electric charge**. It can now attract small pieces of paper.
*   **Rule:**
    *   Like charges repel (+ and +).
    *   Unlike charges attract (+ and -).

### 3. Gravitational Force (Gravity)
Why does an apple fall down? Because the Earth pulls it.
*   **Definition:** The force of attraction between any two objects in the universe.
*   **On Earth:** The Earth pulls everything towards its center. This pull is called the **Force of Gravity**.
*   **Nature:** Gravity is *always* attractive. It never repels.
