## Upthrust (Buoyant Force)

Have you noticed that a mug feels lighter when dipped in a bucket of water? Or that it's hard to push an empty plastic bottle underwater?

This is because liquids exert an **upward force** on objects immersed in them. This upward force is called **Upthrust** or **Buoyant Force**.

### Why do objects float or sink?

It is a battle between two forces:
1.  **Gravity (Weight):** Pulls the object **down**.
2.  **Upthrust:** Pushes the object **up**.

*   **Sinks:** If Weight > Upthrust.
*   **Floats:** If Weight = Upthrust.
*   **Rises:** If Upthrust > Weight (like releasing a submerged plastic ball).

### Archimedes' Principle
A Greek scientist named Archimedes discovered that the upward buoyant force is equal to the **weight of the liquid displaced** by the object.
*   If an object displaces a lot of water (like a large ship), the upthrust is huge, allowing it to float even if it is heavy!
