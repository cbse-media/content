## Mass vs. Weight

These two terms are often used interchangeably in daily life, but in science, they are very different.

| Feature | Mass | Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | The amount of matter in an object. | The force with which Earth attracts an object. |
| **Changeability** | Constant everywhere (Earth, Moon, Space). | Changes based on gravity (Lighter on Moon). |
| **SI Unit** | Kilogram (kg) | Newton (N) |
| **Measurement Device** | Beam Balance | Spring Balance |

<Callout variant="info">
**Did you know?** An object on the Moon weighs **1/6th** of its weight on Earth because the Moon's gravity is weaker. However, its mass (kg) remains exactly the same.

## Measuring Weight: The Spring Balance

A spring balance measures weight by the stretching of a spring.
1.  **Principle:** The Earth pulls the object down.
2.  **Action:** This force stretches the spring.
3.  **Reading:** The extent of stretching corresponds to the weight (Force) in Newtons.

### Reading a Spring Balance
To measure accurately, you must find the **Least Count** (the value of one small division).
*   *Example:* If the range 0 to 1 N has 5 divisions, then 1 division = $1 \div 5 = 0.2 \text{ N}$.
