## Page 1: Probe and Ponder

**Q1: What is happening in the picture?**
**Answer:** The picture shows people collecting salt. They likely use sea water, allow it to evaporate in shallow pits, leaving the salt (solute) behind. This demonstrates the separation of a dissolved solid from a liquid solvent.

**Q2: What happens when you add too much sugar to tea?**
**Answer:** When you add too much sugar, the solution becomes **saturated**. The extra sugar stops dissolving and settles at the bottom.
*   **Solution:** You can dissolve it by **heating** the tea (increasing temperature increases solubility).

**Q3: Why do sugar/salt dissolve in water but not oil?**
**Answer:** Water is a polar solvent ("like dissolves like"), good for dissolving ionic/polar substances like salt and sugar. Oil is non-polar and cannot break the bonds in salt/sugar crystals effectively.

**Q4: Why are water bottles tall and cylindrical?**
**Answer:** Cylindrical shapes are structurally strong (withstand pressure evenly), easy to hold, and efficient for packing/transport compared to spheres which would roll away and waste space between them.
