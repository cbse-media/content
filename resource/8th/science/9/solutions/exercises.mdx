## Questions and Answers

### 1. True/False
(i) Oxygen is more soluble in hot water. **(False)** - Gas solubility decreases with heat.
(ii) Sand and water is a solution. **(False)** - It is a non-uniform mixture (Suspension).
(iii) Space occupied is mass. **(False)** - Space is Volume.
(iv) Unsaturated has more solute than saturated. **(False)** - Saturated has the maximum possible.
(v) Mixture of gases is a solution. **(True)** - Air is a gaseous solution.

### 2. Fill in the Blanks
(i) immersed/dipped; rise/increase.
(ii) solute; solvent (or solution).
(iii) decreases. (Heating expands volume, Mass stays same, so $D=M/V$ decreases).
(iv) saturated.

### 3. Oil on Water
**Answer:** (i) **Oil is lighter (less dense) than water.** *Note: The question asks "Oil floats... what does this tell you?". Usually implies lesser density.* However, technically "Lighter" is a vague term, "Less Dense" is scientific.
*Checking options:* (i) Oil is denser (False), (ii) Water is denser (True), (iii) Same density (False), (iv) Dissolves (False).
**Correct Selection:** (ii) Water is denser than oil (or Oil is less dense than water).

### 4. Stone Density
*   Mass ($m$) = 225 g
*   Volume ($V$) = 90 cm³
*   Density = $225 / 90 = 2.5 \text{ g/cm}^3$.
*   **Prediction:** Water density is $1 \text{ g/cm}^3$. Since $2.5 > 1$, the stone will **sink**.

### 5. Saturated Solution Statement
**Answer:** (iii) **No more solute can be dissolved into the saturated solution at that temperature.** (This is the definition).

### 6. Bottle Capacity
*   Total Capacity = 2 Litres = 2000 mL.
*   Filled = 500 mL.
*   More needed = $2000 - 500 = 1500 \text{ mL}$ (or 1.5 Litres).

### 7. Calculate Density
*   $m$ = 400 g
*   $V$ = 40 cm³
*   Density = $400 / 40 = 10 \text{ g/cm}^3$.

### 8. Orange Float/Sink (Fig 9.25)
*   **Unpeeled Orange:** Floats. The peel contains porous air pockets, lowering the overall density of the orange to less than water.
*   **Peeled Orange:** Sinks. Without the airy peel, the dense fruit flesh is denser than water.

### 9. Which is Denser?
*   **Object A:** $D = 200 / 40 = 5 \text{ g/cm}^3$.
*   **Object B:** $D = 240 / 60 = 4 \text{ g/cm}^3$.
*   **Answer:** **Object A** is denser.

### 10. Clay Modeling
**Answer:** Density will **remain the same**.
*   Density is an intrinsic property of the material. Changing shape (cube to sheet) does not change the Mass or the Volume of the material itself.

### 11. Iron Block Volume
*   Mass = 600 g
*   Density = 7.9 g/cm³
*   Formula: $V = m / D$
*   $V = 600 / 7.9 \approx 75.95 \text{ cm}^3$.

### 12. Hot Water Experiment (Fig 9.26)
*   **Observation:** Water level rises in the tube when placed in hot water.
*   **Reason:** Heat causes water to **expand** (Volume increases).
*   **Effect on Density:** Since Mass is constant and Volume increases, Density **decreases**.
