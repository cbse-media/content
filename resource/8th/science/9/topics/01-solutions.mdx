## What is a Solution?

A **Solution** is a uniform (homogeneous) mixture of two or more substances.
*   **Components:**
    1.  **Solute:** The substance that dissolves (e.g., Salt, Sugar).
    2.  **Solvent:** The substance in which the solute dissolves (e.g., Water).

$$
\text{Solute} + \text{Solvent} \rightarrow \text{Solution}
$$

### Examples
1.  **Salt Water:** Salt (Solute) + Water (Solvent).
2.  **Air:** A gaseous solution where Nitrogen is the solvent (largest quantity) and Oxygen/Argon are solutes.
3.  **ORS:** Oral Rehydration Solution is a uniform mixture of salt, sugar, and water.

**Uniform vs. Non-Uniform:**
*   **Uniform:** Salt in water. Every sip tastes the same.
*   **Non-Uniform:** Sand in water. Sand settles at the bottom; it is not evenly distributed.

### Concentration
*   **Dilute Solution:** Contains a small amount of solute.
*   **Concentrated Solution:** Contains a large amount of solute.
