## What is Density?

Density is a measure of how "packed" matter is in an object. It is defined as mass per unit volume.

$$
\text{Density} (\rho) = \frac{\text{Mass } (m)}{\text{Volume } (V)}
$$

*   **SI Unit:** $kg/m^3$
*   **Common Unit:** $g/cm^3$ or $g/mL$

### Measuring Density
To find the density of an irregular stone:
1.  **Find Mass ($m$):** Weigh it on a digital balance.
2.  **Find Volume ($V$):** Use the water displacement method in a measuring cylinder.
    *   $V = \text{Final Water Level} - \text{Initial Water Level}$.
3.  **Calculate:** Divide Mass by Volume.

**Example:**
*   Mass of stone = 50 g
*   Volume of stone = 20 cm³
*   Density = $50 / 20 = 2.5 \text{ g/cm}^3$
</Callout>

### Factors Affecting Density
1.  **Temperature:** generally, heating causes expansion (Volume increases), so **Density decreases**.
    *   *Hot air rises because it is less dense than cold air.*
2.  **Pressure:** High pressure compresses gases (Volume decreases), so **Density increases**.
