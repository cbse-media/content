# Keeping Time with the Skies

Have you ever wondered why a week has 7 days, or why a month is roughly 30 days? The answer lies above us. For thousands of years, humans have looked at the sky to measure time. This chapter explores the natural clocks provided by the Earth, Moon, and Sun.

We will learn why the Moon changes shape, how calendars were invented to track seasons, and how modern satellites help us today.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Phases of the Moon**: Why the moon waxes and wanes.
2.  **Units of Time**: How celestial motion defines the Day, Month, and Year.
3.  **Calendars**: The difference between Lunar, Solar, and Luni-solar calendars.
4.  **Satellites**: Natural (Moon) vs. Artificial (Man-made).

## Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mean Solar Day** | The average time (24 hours) for the Sun to return to the highest point in the sky. |
| **Solar Year** | The time Earth takes to complete one revolution around the Sun (~365.25 days). |
| **Lunar Month** | The time for the Moon to cycle through all its phases (~29.5 days). |
| **Waxing** | The period when the illuminated part of the Moon is **growing**. |
| **Waning** | The period when the illuminated part of the Moon is **shrinking**. |
| **New Moon (Amavasya)** | When the Moon is between Earth and Sun; the illuminated side faces away from us. |
| **Full Moon (Purnima)** | When Earth is between Moon and Sun; the entire illuminated side faces us. |
| **Leap Year** | A year with an extra day (366 days) added to synchronize the calendar with Earth's revolution. |

**Scientific Heritage:**
The **Saha Equation**, developed by Indian astrophysicist **Meghnad Saha**, is crucial for understanding stars. He also led the committee that established India's Unified National Calendar.
