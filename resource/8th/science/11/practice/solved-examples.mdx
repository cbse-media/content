## The 50-Minute Delay

**Observation:** You noticed in the chapter that the Moon rises about 50 minutes later every day. Why?

**The Physics:**
1.  Earth rotates $360^\circ$ in 24 hours.
2.  While Earth rotates, the Moon revolves around Earth in the same direction.
3.  In 24 hours, the Moon moves about $12^\circ$ to $13^\circ$ in its orbit.
4.  So, when Earth completes one full rotation (360 degrees), the Moon is no longer in the same spot—it has moved ahead!
5.  Earth has to rotate an *extra* $13^\circ$ to catch up to the Moon.

**The Math:**
*   Earth rotates $360^\circ$ in $1440$ minutes (24 hrs).
*   Speed of rotation: $1440 / 360 = 4$ minutes per degree.
*   Extra rotation needed: $\approx 12.5^\circ$.
*   Time taken: $12.5^\circ \times 4 \text{ min/degree} = 50$ minutes.

**Conclusion:** That is why Moonrise is delayed by 50 minutes daily.

## Activity Analysis: Shadow Sticks (Activity 11.3)

**Goal:** Find the shortest shadow to determine "Local Noon".

**Procedure:**
1.  Place a stick vertically on flat ground.
2.  Mark the tip of the shadow every 10 minutes from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM.
3.  Measure the length of the shadow at each mark.

**Outcome:**
*   The shadow is longest in the morning and evening.
*   The shadow is **shortest** exactly when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky.
*   This moment is **Local Noon**. It might not be exactly 12:00 PM on your watch (which follows Standard Time for the whole country).

<Callout variant="tip">
**Did you know?**
The line connecting the North and South celestial poles passing directly overhead is called the **Meridian**. When the Sun crosses the meridian, it is noon. "AM" stands for *Ante Meridiem* (Before Meridian) and "PM" stands for *Post Meridiem* (After Meridian).
