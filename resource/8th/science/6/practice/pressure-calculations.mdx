## Formula Review
$$
P = \frac{F}{A}
$$

### Problem 1: The High Heels vs. Flat Shoes
A girl weighs $500 \text{ N}$.
1.  **Case A:** She wears flat shoes with a total sole area of $0.05 \text{ m}^2$.
2.  **Case B:** She wears high heels where the weight is concentrated on a heel area of just $0.001 \text{ m}^2$ (assume she stands on one heel for a moment).

**Calculate the pressure in both cases.**

**Case A (Flats):**
$$P = \frac{500}{0.05} = \frac{500}{5/100} = 500 \times 20 = \mathbf{10,000 \text{ Pa}}$$

**Case B (Heels):**
$$P = \frac{500}{0.001} = \frac{500}{1/1000} = 500 \times 1000 = \mathbf{500,000 \text{ Pa}}$$

*Observation: The heels exert 50 times more pressure! This is why heels sink into grass.*

### Problem 2: The Brick
A brick has dimensions $20 \text{ cm} \times 10 \text{ cm} \times 5 \text{ cm}$ and weighs $20 \text{ N}$.
Calculate the **maximum** and **minimum** pressure it can exert on the ground.

*Hint: Max pressure occurs on the smallest area. Min pressure occurs on the largest area.*

**Step 1: Calculate Areas (convert to meters!)**
*   Face 1 ($20 \times 10$): $0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \text{ m}^2$
*   Face 2 ($20 \times 5$): $0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01 \text{ m}^2$ (Smallest Area)
*   Face 3 ($10 \times 5$): $0.1 \times 0.05 = 0.005 \text{ m}^2$ ... Wait.
    *   $20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ cm}^2$
    *   $20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ cm}^2$
    *   $10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ cm}^2$ (Smallest Area is actually this one).

**Correction:**
*   Largest Area ($20 \times 10$): $0.02 \text{ m}^2$.
*   Smallest Area ($10 \times 5$): $0.005 \text{ m}^2$.

**Step 2: Calculate Pressure**
*   **Minimum Pressure** (Largest Area):
    $$P = \frac{20}{0.02} = \mathbf{1000 \text{ Pa}}$$
*   **Maximum Pressure** (Smallest Area):
    $$P = \frac{20}{0.005} = \mathbf{4000 \text{ Pa}}$$
