## Page 1 Questions

**Q1: Why are winds stronger on some days than on others?**
**Answer:** Wind speed depends on the **pressure difference** between two regions. If the difference between the High Pressure and Low Pressure areas is very large, the air rushes faster to fill the gap, resulting in stronger winds.

**Q2: Why are water tanks usually placed at a height?**
**Answer:** Liquid pressure depends on the **height of the water column** (depth). Placing the tank high on a roof increases the vertical distance (height) between the tank and the taps on the ground floor. This creates higher pressure, ensuring a strong flow of water.

**Q3: Can air pressure really crush us?**
**Answer:** Theoretically, the weight of the atmosphere is massive (like carrying a car on your head!). However, it doesn't crush us because our bodies contain fluids and air that exert an **internal pressure** equal to the atmospheric pressure, balancing the forces.

**Q4: If the Earth stopped rotating, would cyclones still form?**
**Answer:** Likely not in the same way. The spinning motion of a cyclone is driven by the **Coriolis effect**, which is caused by the Earth's rotation. Without rotation, air would rush directly into low-pressure areas without spiraling, preventing the formation of the characteristic cyclone vortex.
