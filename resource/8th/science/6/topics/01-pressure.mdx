## The Concept of Pressure

Imagine two students, Megha and Pawan, carrying identical heavy bags. Megha is comfortable, but Pawan is in pain.
*   **Megha's Bag:** Broad straps.
*   **Pawan's Bag:** Narrow straps.

Why does the narrow strap hurt more? The **weight** (force) is the same, but the **area** of contact is different.

### Definition

**Pressure** is the force acting perpendicularly on a unit area of a surface.

$$
\text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}}
$$

*   **SI Unit:** Newton per square metre ($N/m^2$), also called **Pascal (Pa)**.

### Effect of Area on Pressure

Since Area is in the denominator of the formula, changing the area has the opposite effect on pressure.

1.  **Decreasing Area increases Pressure:**
    *   **Knives:** Have very sharp edges (small area) to cut easily with less force.
    *   **Nails:** Have pointed tips to drive into walls easily.

2.  **Increasing Area decreases Pressure:**
    *   **School Bags:** Wide straps spread the weight over a larger shoulder area, reducing pain.
    *   **Porters:** Place a round cloth (*pagdi*) on their heads to increase the contact area for heavy loads.
    *   **Dams:** Have broad bases to withstand high water pressure at the bottom.

**Example Calculation:**
If a force of $100 \text{ N}$ acts on an area of $2 \text{ m}^2$:
$$P = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ Pa}$$
If the same force acts on an area of $1 \text{ m}^2$:
$$P = \frac{100}{1} = 100 \text{ Pa}$$
**Halving the area doubles the pressure!**
