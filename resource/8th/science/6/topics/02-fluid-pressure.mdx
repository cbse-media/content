## Pressure Exerted by Liquids

Liquids and gases are collectively called **fluids**. Unlike solids, fluids exert pressure in **all directions** (downwards, sideways, and upwards).

### Key Properties of Liquid Pressure:

1.  **Pressure increases with Depth:**
    *   The deeper you go, the more weight of water is above you.
    *   *Activity:* If you attach a balloon to the bottom of a pipe and fill it with water, the balloon bulges. If you fill it higher (more depth), the balloon bulges *more*.
2.  **Liquids exert pressure on walls:**
    *   *Activity:* A plastic bottle with holes at the bottom will shoot water out. This proves water pushes sideways against the container walls.
3.  **Pressure is equal at the same depth:**
    *   If you make holes at the *same height* all around a bottle, water spurts out the same distance from all holes.

### Why are Dam walls thicker at the bottom?
Because water pressure is highest at the bottom of the reservoir. A thick base is needed to withstand this immense horizontal pressure.

## Atmospheric Pressure

We live at the bottom of a huge ocean of air called the **Atmosphere**. Air has weight, and this weight exerts pressure on us.

*   **Atmospheric Pressure:** The pressure exerted by the air around us.
*   **Magnitude:** On an area of $15 \text{ cm} \times 15 \text{ cm}$ (roughly the size of your head), the force of air is nearly **2250 N** (equal to a mass of 225 kg).

### Why don't we get crushed?
Because the pressure *inside* our bodies (blood pressure, dissolved gases) is roughly equal to the atmospheric pressure outside. They balance each other out.

### The Rubber Sucker Experiment
When you press a rubber sucker against a wall, you force the air out from between the cup and the wall.
*   **Inside:** Vacuum (Low pressure).
*   **Outside:** Atmospheric air (High pressure).
*   **Result:** The atmosphere pushes the sucker firmly against the wall, making it stick.
