## 1. The Dancing Particles (Diffusion)

This experiment demonstrates how temperature affects particle movement.

**Materials:**
*   3 clear glasses.
*   Potassium Permanganate crystals (or food coloring).
*   Hot water, Room temp water, Cold water.

**Procedure:**
1.  Fill glass 1 with cold water, glass 2 with room temp water, glass 3 with hot water.
2.  Drop one crystal of Potassium Permanganate (or a drop of food color) into each glass simultaneously. **DO NOT STIR.**
3.  Observe.

**Observation:**
*   **Hot Water:** The color spreads (diffuses) very quickly.
*   **Cold Water:** The color spreads very slowly, sinking to the bottom first.

**Scientific Conclusion:**
Particles of matter are constantly moving (Kinetic Energy). Heat gives particles more energy, making them move faster. Therefore, diffusion is faster at higher temperatures.

## 2. Balloon in Hot Water

**Materials:**
*   Empty plastic bottle.
*   Balloon.
*   Bowl of hot water.

**Procedure:**
1.  Stretch the balloon over the mouth of the empty bottle.
2.  Place the bottle into the bowl of hot water.

**Observation:**
The balloon inflates slightly.

**Conclusion:**
The air inside the bottle is a gas. When heated, the air particles gain energy and move faster/farther apart (Expansion). This increased volume and pressure pushes into the balloon, inflating it.
