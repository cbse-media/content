## Is Matter Continuous or Particulate?

If you look at a piece of chalk, it looks like one continuous block. But if you grind it, it becomes powder. If you view that powder under a microscope, you see even smaller grains.
*   **Conclusion:** Matter is not a single continuous block; it is made up of a large number of extremely small **constituent particles**.

### Evidence of Interparticle Space
**Activity: Dissolving Sugar in Water**
1.  Take a glass of water and mark the level.
2.  Dissolve two teaspoons of sugar.
3.  **Observation:** The water tastes sweet, but the water level **does not increase** significantly.

**Why?**
Where did the sugar go? The tiny sugar particles separated and occupied the empty **spaces** available between the water particles.
*   This proves that there are gaps between particles of matter, known as **Interparticle Spaces**.

### What holds them together?
Particles are held together by **Interparticle Attractions**. The strength of this force decides the state of matter (Solid, Liquid, or Gas).
