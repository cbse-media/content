## Summary: Solid vs Liquid vs Gas

The differences in states are due to the arrangement and energy of the particles.

| Property | Solid | Liquid | Gas |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shape** | Fixed | Not fixed (Takes container's shape) | Not fixed |
| **Volume** | Fixed | Fixed | Not fixed (Fills container) |
| **Interparticle Space** | Minimum (Very small) | Moderate | Maximum |
| **Interparticle Force** | Maximum (Strongest) | Weaker than solids | Negligible (Weakest) |
| **Particle Movement** | Vibrate in fixed position | Move/Slide past each other | Move freely in all directions |
| **Compressibility** | Negligible | Negligible | High |

### Thermal Energy
*   **Solid:** Low thermal energy.
*   **Gas:** High thermal energy.

When you heat a solid, you give its particles energy. They vibrate faster, overcome attraction, and eventually break free to become a liquid (Melting). If you heat further, they fly apart to become a gas (Boiling).
