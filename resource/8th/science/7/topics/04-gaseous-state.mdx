## Characteristics of Gases

Gases (like air, oxygen, smoke) have **no fixed shape** and **no fixed volume**. They fill the entire space available to them.

### Particle Arrangement
1.  **Packing:** Particles are very far apart. Large interparticle spaces.
2.  **Forces:** Attraction is **negligible** (very weak).
3.  **Movement:** Particles move freely and randomly at high speeds.
4.  **Compressibility:** Very High.

### Activity: The Syringe Experiment
If you take a syringe, close the nozzle, and push the piston:
*   **Solid (Chalk):** Cannot push.
*   **Liquid (Water):** Cannot push.
*   **Gas (Air):** Can push easily!
This proves gases have large empty spaces that can be reduced by pressure.

### Diffusion
Diffusion is the spreading out and mixing of a substance with another substance due to the motion of its particles.
*   **Example:** Burning an incense stick in one corner makes the whole room smell good. The smoke particles collide with air particles and spread rapidly.
