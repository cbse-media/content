## Defining Health

Is a person healthy if they have no fever but are constantly stressed and lonely? According to modern science, the answer is **no**.

The **World Health Organization (WHO)** defines health as:
> "A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease."
