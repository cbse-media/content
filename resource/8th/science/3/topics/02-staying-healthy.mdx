## The Role of Lifestyle

Our daily habits dictate our health. A "healthy lifestyle" includes:

1.  **Balanced Diet:** Eating fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoiding processed/sugary foods.
2.  **Physical Activity:** Walking, running, playing sports.
3.  **Sleep:** Getting enough rest allows the body to recover.
4.  **Mental Hygiene:** Meditation, yoga, and managing stress.
5.  **Avoiding Harmful Substances:** Saying 'NO' to tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.

## The Role of Environment

We cannot stay healthy in a dirty environment.
*   **Clean Air:** Air pollution causes respiratory issues like asthma. The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** measures air cleanliness.
*   **Clean Water:** Contaminated water spreads diseases like Cholera and Typhoid.
*   **Sanitation:** Proper waste disposal prevents the breeding of flies and mosquitoes.

### Community Sanitation: The Odisha Example
A community-led sanitation campaign in Bhadrak district, Odisha, promoted toilet usage.
*   **Result:** Significant reduction in open defecation.
*   **Impact:** Fewer cases of diarrhea and infections in children.

**Vectors:** Insects like mosquitoes and houseflies that carry pathogens from dirty environments to humans are called vectors. Keeping our surroundings clean stops them from breeding.
