## Page 1: Probe and Ponder

**Q1: How does your body respond to an infection such as common cold?**
**A:** The immune system detects the virus. It raises body temperature (fever) to kill germs, produces mucus to trap them (runny nose), and induces coughing/sneezing to expel them.

**Q2: We rarely see smallpox/polio, but diabetes is common. Why?**
**A:** Smallpox and Polio are communicable diseases controlled by **Vaccines**. Diabetes is a non-communicable lifestyle disease caused by poor diet and lack of exercise, which are becoming more common in modern life.

**Q3: Could climate change lead to new types of diseases?**
**A:** Yes. Warmer temperatures allow vectors like mosquitoes to survive in new areas, spreading diseases like Dengue and Malaria to regions that were previously too cold for them.

**Q4: How do emotions like stress affect us?**
**A:** Stress releases hormones that can suppress the immune system, making us more susceptible to infections. It can also lead to headaches, insomnia, and high blood pressure.
