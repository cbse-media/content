### Q7. Dengue Cases Graph Analysis

**(i) Which three months were cases highest?**
*   July (65), August (65), September (65).

**(ii) Which month(s) were cases lowest?**

### Q9. Why no antibiotics for viral infections?
**Answer:** Antibiotics are chemicals designed to disrupt specific structures in **bacteria** (like their cell walls). Viruses do not have these structures; they live inside human cells. Therefore, antibiotics cannot harm viruses and taking them contributes to antibiotic resistance.

### Q10. Disease from contaminated water?
**Options:** Hepatitis A, Tuberculosis, Poliomyelitis, Cholera, Chickenpox.
**Answer:**
*   **Hepatitis A** (Yes)
*   **Cholera** (Yes)
*   **Poliomyelitis** (Yes - spreads via fecal-oral route/water)
*   *Tuberculosis is Airborne. Chickenpox is contact/airborne.*

### Q11. Immune Response (First vs Second Exposure)
**Answer:** This is due to **Immunological Memory**.
1.  **First Exposure:** The body takes time to identify the pathogen and create specific antibodies. This is slow.
2.  **Memory Cells:** Some immune cells remain as "memory cells" after the first infection.
3.  **Second Exposure:** These memory cells recognize the pathogen immediately and produce massive amounts of antibodies instantly, often destroying the germ before we even feel sick.
