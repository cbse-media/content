## Introduction

Health is often called our ultimate treasure. But is being "healthy" simply the absence of sickness? In this chapter, we explore the holistic meaning of health, how diseases spread, and the scientific advancements—like vaccines and antibiotics—that protect us.

We will learn that health is a balance of physical, mental, and social well-being, deeply influenced by our lifestyle and environment.
