## Forms of Compensation

People engaged in economic activities receive payment in different ways. The method of payment often depends on the type of work and the agreement between the worker and the employer.

## Value Addition

Economic activities involve transforming something into a more useful form. This process adds monetary value to the object.

### The Carpenter's Example
Let's look at Rajesh, a carpenter, to understand **Value Addition**.

1.  **Raw Material Cost:** Rajesh buys wood for **₹600**.
2.  **The Process:** He uses his tools, skill, time, and effort to build a chair.
3.  **Final Price:** He sells the chair for **₹1,000**.

$$
\text{Value Added} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost of Raw Materials}
$$

$$
\text{Value Added} = \text{Rs.}1,000 - \text{Rs.}600 = \text{Rs.}400
$$

**What is the ₹400 for?**
It represents the monetary value of Rajesh's **skill, time, and effort**. By turning raw wood into a finished chair, he has "added value" to it.

**Conclusion:** Economic activities create value at every stage of processing, transforming raw materials into useful goods.
