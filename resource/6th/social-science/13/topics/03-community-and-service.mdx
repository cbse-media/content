## The Importance of Non-Economic Activities

While non-economic activities do not generate money, they are vital for personal well-being and social harmony. They foster love, respect, and a sense of belonging.

### Sevā: Selfless Service
**Sevā** refers to service performed without the expectation of any reward or payment. It gives a deep sense of satisfaction.

**Examples of Sevā:**
*   **Langars:** Community kitchens in Gurudwaras that serve free food to everyone, regardless of their background.
*   **Temples/Mosques/Churches:** Distributing *prasād* or helping the needy.

### Community Participation
When people come together to work for the common good, it is called community participation. Collective efforts can solve problems that individuals cannot solve alone.

#### 1. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
This is a nationwide campaign in India based on collective effort.
*   **Goal:** To keep streets, roads, and infrastructure clean.
*   **Action:** Citizens volunteer to clean public spaces.
*   **Result:** A cleaner home, neighborhood, and nation.

#### 2. Van Mahotsav
Known as the "Festival of Forests," this is an annual tree-planting movement in India.
*   **Goal:** Promote awareness about the value of trees and forest conservation.
*   **Action:** Communities gather for tree plantation drives.
