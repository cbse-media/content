# The Value of Work

> "When you are doing any work, do not think of anything beyond. Do it as worship, as the highest worship, and devote your whole life to it for the time being." — **Swami Vivekananda**

## Introduction

Every day, we see people around us engaged in various activities. From a pilot flying a plane to a shopkeeper selling uniforms, and from a software engineer developing apps to a mother cooking for her family—everyone is busy doing something.

In this chapter, we explore the **nature of these activities**. We will learn why some work earns money while other work does not, and why both are equally important for our lives and society.

## The Big Questions

1.  What are the different types of activities that people engage in?
2.  What is their contribution to our everyday lives?

## Chapter Overview

We will divide our study into three main sections:

1.  **Economic vs. Non-Economic Activities**: Understanding the difference between work done for money and work done for love or duty.
2.  **Compensation & Value Addition**: How people get paid (Salary, Wage, Fee) and how work adds value to raw materials.
3.  **Community & Service**: The importance of selfless service (*Seva*) and community participation.

**Activity:** As you read through, think about the work your family members do. Try to classify them into the categories we discuss!
