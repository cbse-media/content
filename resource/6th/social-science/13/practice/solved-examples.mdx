## Think About It: Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Grandfather teaching neighborhood kids for free.**
*   **Question:** Is this economic or non-economic? How is it different from school teachers?
*   **Solution:** This is a **Non-Economic Activity**. Even though the action (teaching) is the same as a school teacher, the motive is **social service** or personal satisfaction, and there is no monetary exchange (Salary/Fee). A school teacher does it as a profession for a livelihood.

**Scenario 2: Festivals and Food.**
*   **Question:** During festivals, people decorate and cook together. Why does this hold value?
*   **Solution:** These are **Non-Economic Activities**. They hold value because they build **community strength**, preserve **culture**, and provide **emotional well-being**. The joy shared during a festival cannot be bought with money.
