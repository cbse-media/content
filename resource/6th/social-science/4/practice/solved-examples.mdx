## Practice Problems

### Example 1: Calculating Millenniums
**Question:** In which millennium does the year 2500 BCE fall?
**Solution:**
Millenniums are counted in blocks of 1,000 years starting from 1 BCE (counting backward).
*   1st Millennium BCE: 1 to 1000 BCE
*   2nd Millennium BCE: 1001 to 2000 BCE
*   3rd Millennium BCE: 2001 to 3000 BCE
**Answer:** The year 2500 BCE falls in the **3rd Millennium BCE**.

### Example 2: The "No Year Zero" Rule
**Question:** A traveler started a journey in 5 BCE and finished in 5 CE. How many years did the journey take?
**Solution:**
$$
\text{Total Years} = (5 + 5) - 1 = 9 \text{ years}
$$
**Why?** Because the sequence is: 5BCE, 4BCE, 3BCE, 2BCE, 1BCE, 1CE, 2CE, 3CE, 4CE, 5CE. Counting these, we get 10 positions, but the *duration* across the gap is 9 years.

### Example 3: Inscription Dating
**Question:** An inscription says it was carved in the 2nd century BCE. What is the possible range of years?
**Solution:**
*   1st Century BCE: 1 to 100 BCE
*   2nd Century BCE: 101 to 200 BCE
**Answer:** The range is **200 BCE to 101 BCE**. (Remember, BCE counts backward!)

**Quick Check:**
If the year is CE, move forward in time. If the year is BCE, the larger number is further in the past.
