## Questions and Activities

### Q1. Can we compare historians to detectives? Give reasons.
**Answer:** Yes, historians are very much like detectives.
*   **Evidence:** Just as a detective looks for clues at a crime scene, a historian looks for "sources" (coins, pots, old texts).
*   **Reconstruction:** Detectives piece together what happened during a crime; historians piece together what happened hundreds or thousands of years ago.
*   **Verification:** Detectives check if witness statements match physical evidence; historians check if literary sources (like a book) match archaeological sources (like an inscription).

### Q2. Dating Exercises

#### A. Place these dates chronologically on a timeline:
*   *Dates:* 323 CE, 323 BCE, 100 CE, 100 BCE, 1900 BCE, 1090 CE, 2024 CE.

**Chronological Order (Oldest to Newest):**
1. 1900 BCE
2. 323 BCE
3. 100 BCE
4. 100 CE
5. 323 CE
6. 1090 CE
7. 2024 CE

#### B. If King Chandragupta was born in 320 CE, which century did he belong to? And how many years was that after the Buddha’s birth (560 BCE)?
1.  **Century:** 320 CE falls in the **$4^{\text{th}}$ Century CE**.
2.  **Years after Buddha's birth:**
    *   Formula: $(\text{Year in BCE} + \text{Year in CE}) - 1$
    *   Calculation: $(560 + 320) - 1 = 880 - 1 = \mathbf{879 \text{ years}}$.

#### C. Rani of Jhansi was born in 1828. Which century did she belong to? How many years was that before India’s Independence (1947)?
1.  **Century:** 1828 falls in the **$19^{\text{th}}$ Century CE**.
2.  **Years before Independence:**
    *   Calculation: $1947 - 1828 = \mathbf{119 \text{ years}}$.

#### D. Turn ‘12,000 years ago’ into a date (assuming the current year is 2024).
*   Calculation: $12000 - 2024 = 9976$
*   Date: **9976 BCE**.
