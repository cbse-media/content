## Specialists of the Past

Many different experts work together to uncover the secrets of our past. Each looks at a different type of evidence.

### 1. Geologists
They study the physical features of the Earth, such as soil, stones, mountains, and oceans.

### 2. Palaeontologists
They study the remains of plants, animals, and humans from millions of years ago, which are preserved as **fossils**.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Fossils:** Impressions of footprints, or parts of plants or animals found preserved within layers of soil or rocks.

### 3. Anthropologists
They study human societies and cultures, looking at how they have changed from ancient times to the present.

### 4. Archaeologists
They dig up remains left behind by people, such as tools, pots, beads, figurines, and even the ruins of houses.

## The Timeline of Life on Earth

Human history is only a tiny fraction of the Earth's total history.
