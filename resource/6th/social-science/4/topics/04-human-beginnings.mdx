## Early Humans (Homo sapiens)

Modern humans have existed for about 300,000 years. For most of this time, they were **hunters and gatherers**.

*   **Social Life:** Lived in small groups called **bands**.
*   **Survival:** Relied on hunting animals and gathering wild plants/fruits.
*   **Technology:** Made stone axes, blades, and arrowheads.
*   **Art:** Created rock paintings in caves depicting animals and human figures.

## The Impact of Climate Change

The Earth experienced several **Ice Ages**—periods when much of the Earth was covered in ice. The last Ice Age ended about **12,000 years ago**.

## The First Crops and Settlements

As the climate warmed, humans began to settle down.

1.  **Agriculture:** They started cultivating cereals and grains.
2.  **Domestication:** They began taming animals like cattle and goats.
3.  **Settlements:** Humans built **hamlets** (small villages) near rivers for water and fertile soil.
4.  **Social Complexity:** Leaders or **chieftains** emerged to manage the community's **welfare**.

**Collective Living:** In early agricultural societies, there was often no individual ownership. Land was sowed and harvested collectively.
