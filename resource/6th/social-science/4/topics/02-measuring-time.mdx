## The Gregorian Calendar

At present, the **Gregorian calendar** is the most commonly used worldwide. It uses the conventional year of Jesus Christ's birth as a starting point.

### BCE and CE
*   **CE (Common Era):** Refers to years after the starting point. Formerly known as **AD** (*Anno Domini*). Example: 1947 CE.
*   **BCE (Before Common Era):** Refers to years before the starting point. These are counted backward. Formerly known as **BC** (*Before Christ*). Example: 560 BCE.

<Callout variant="warning">
**Crucial Note:** There is no "Year 0". The year 1 CE follows immediately after 1 BCE.
</Callout>

## Calculating Time Durations

To find how many years have passed between a BCE date and a CE date:
1.  Add the two numbers.
2.  Subtract 1 (because there is no year 0).

**Example:** How many years ago was 560 BCE from 2024 CE?
$$
560 + 2024 - 1 = 2583 \text{ years}
$$

## Units of Time

| Term | Duration | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decade** | 10 Years | 2010 to 2019 |
| **Century** | 100 Years | 21st Century (2001–2100) |
| **Millennium** | 1,000 Years | 3rd Millennium (2001–3000) |

<Callout variant="tip">
**Calculating Centuries:**
To find the century of a year, look at the hundreds place and add 1.
*   Year 320 CE: $3 + 1 = 4^{\text{th}}$ Century CE.
*   Year 1828 CE: $18 + 1 = 19^{\text{th}}$ Century CE.
