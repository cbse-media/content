## Introduction

History is "an unending dialogue between the present and the past." To understand the world we live in today, we must look back at the societies of yesterday. This chapter explores the tools historians use to measure time, the evidence they gather to piece together the past, and the journey of early humans from hunters to farmers.

**The Big Questions:**
1. How do we measure historical time?
2. How can various sources help us understand history?
3. How did early humans live?

## Formula Sheet: Calculating Time

In the Gregorian calendar, there is **no year zero**. To calculate the duration between a BCE date and a CE date, use the following formula:

$$
\text{Total Years} = (\text{Year in BCE} + \text{Year in CE}) - 1
$$

*Example:* Between 2 BCE and 2 CE: $(2 + 2) - 1 = 3$ years.
