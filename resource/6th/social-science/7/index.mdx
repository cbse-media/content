## Introduction

Indian culture is often compared to an ancient tree with many roots and branches. While there are diverse manifestations of this culture—art, science, religion, and governance—they are united by a common trunk. This chapter explores the early "schools of thought" and spiritual seekers who shaped India's unique personality.

We will delve into the Vedic age, the emergence of the Upanishads, and the rise of distinct paths like Buddhism and Jainism, alongside the rich contributions of folk and tribal traditions.
