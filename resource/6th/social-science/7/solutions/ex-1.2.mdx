**1. If you were Nachiketa, what questions would you like to ask Yama?**
*   *Note: This is a creative writing exercise. Below is a sample approach.*
*   **Sample Answer:** "O Yama, beyond the question of what happens after death, I would ask: What is the purpose of this life if it is destined to end? How can one live a life that is truly meaningful? Is destiny written for us, or do our actions alone shape our future?"

**2. Explain a few central ideas of Buddhism. Briefly comment upon them.**
*   **Avidya (Ignorance):** The Buddha taught that ignorance of the true nature of reality is the root of suffering.
*   **Attachment:** Clinging to temporary things leads to pain.
*   **Ahimsa (Non-violence):** This means not injuring any living being in thought, word, or deed.
*   **Comment:** These ideas focus on internal psychology and discipline rather than external rituals. They suggest that happiness is a state of mind achieved by removing negative habits.

**3. Discuss the quotation of the Buddha regarding bathing in sacred rivers.**
*   **Quote:** "Not by water is one made pure... But one is pure in whom truth and dharma reside."
*   **Meaning:** External rituals, like bathing in holy rivers, do not cleanse a person of their bad actions or character. True purity comes from within—by living a life of truth and righteousness (*Dharma*).

**4. Explain a few central ideas of Jainism. Briefly comment upon them.**
*   **Anekantavada (Many-sidedness):** The truth is complex and has many angles; no single view is complete. This promotes intellectual tolerance.
*   **Aparigraha (Non-possession):** One should limit material possessions to what is essential. This reduces greed and inequality.
*   **Ahimsa:** Absolute non-violence towards all sentient beings.
*   **Comment:** These principles remain highly relevant today for promoting peace (Ahimsa), tolerance in society (Anekantavada), and sustainability (Aparigraha).

**5. Consider and discuss André Béteille’s thought on tribal religions.**
*   **Thought:** Tribal religions and Hinduism have mutually influenced each other. It is not a one-way street where tribes just copied Hinduism; Hinduism also absorbed tribal elements throughout its evolution.
*   **Discussion Point:** This highlights the fluid and inclusive nature of Indian culture, where "Folk" and "Classical" traditions are deeply intertwined. Examples like Lord Jagannath prove this synthesis.

**6. Make a list of popular gods and goddesses in your region.**
*   *Activity for students based on their locality.* (e.g., Ganesha in Maharashtra, Durga in Bengal, Murugan in Tamil Nadu).

**7. List two or three tribal groups from your region or State.**
*   *Activity for students.* (e.g., Gonds in Central India, Santhals in the East, Bhils in the West, Khasis in the Northeast).
