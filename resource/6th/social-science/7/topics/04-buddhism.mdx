## The Origins

Buddhism emerged as a school of thought that did not accept the authority of the Vedas. It was founded by **Siddhartha Gautama** roughly 2,500 years ago (approx. 560 BCE).

### The Turning Point
Siddhartha was a prince who lived a protected life. At age 29, he saw four sights that changed his life:
1.  An old man
2.  A sick man
3.  A dead body
4.  An **ascetic** (who appeared happy and at peace)

Realizing the suffering inherent in life, he left his palace to find the root cause of this suffering.

## Enlightenment and Teachings

After years of searching and meditating under a pipal tree at **Bodh Gaya** (Bihar), he attained enlightenment. He became known as the **Buddha** ('The Awakened One').

### Core Realizations
The Buddha identified the sources of human suffering:
*   **Avidya:** Ignorance.
*   **Attachment:** Craving and bonding to temporary things.

### Key Values
*   **Ahimsa:** Often translated as non-violence, it originally meant 'non-injuring' or 'non-hurting'.
*   **Inner Discipline:** Conquering oneself is greater than conquering others.

> "Conquering oneself is greater than conquering a thousand men on the battlefield a thousand times." — The Buddha

### The Sangha
The Buddha founded the **Sangha**, a community of:
*   **Bhikshus** (Monks)
*   **Bhikshunis** (Nuns)

These were individuals who dedicated their lives to practicing and spreading the Dharma (teachings).

### Jataka Tales
Buddhism used stories called **Jataka tales** (stories of the Buddha's former births) to teach values.
*   *Example:* The story of the **Monkey King** who sacrificed his own body to form a bridge so his troop could escape human hunters. This illustrated selflessness and leadership.

**Think About It**
Ahmsa is not just about physical non-violence. It includes refraining from violence in thought, such as ill will or self-criticism.
