## What are the Vedas?

The word **"Veda"** comes from the Sanskrit root *vid*, which means 'knowledge'. The Vedas are the most ancient texts of India and among the oldest in the world.

There are four Vedas:
1.  **Rig Veda** (The most ancient)
2.  **Yajur Veda**
3.  **Sama Veda**
4.  **Atharva Veda**

### Oral Tradition
The Vedas consist of thousands of hymns (poems and songs). Unlike modern books, these were **recited orally** and not written down for centuries. They were composed in the **Sapta Sindhava** region.

**Did You Know?**
The transmission of the Vedas was so meticulous that they were passed down for over 100 to 200 generations with hardly any alterations. In 2008, UNESCO recognised Vedic chanting as **'a masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity'**.

### Vedic Deities and Worldview
The hymns were composed by *rishis* (sages) and *rishikas* (female sages). They were addressed to various deities representing forces of nature and cosmic order (*ritam*).

*   **Indra**
*   **Agni** (Fire)
*   **Varuna**
*   **Mitra**
*   **Sarasvati**
*   **Ushas** (Dawn)

Despite the multiplicity of gods, the early sages perceived a unity behind them. A famous hymn from the Rig Veda states:

$$
\text{ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti}
$$

**Translation:** "The Existent [Supreme Reality] is one, but sages give it many names."

### Concept of Truth
In the Vedic worldview, **Truth** (often synonymous with God) was a central value. The texts emphasize unity among people, calling for common purpose and harmony.
