While texts like the Vedas recorded formal knowledge, India also has rich **oral traditions** maintained by common people (folk) and tribes.

## What is a Tribe?

*   **Modern Definition:** A group of families sharing a common descent, culture, and language, living as a close-knit community under a chief, usually without private property.
*   **Ancient Context:** Ancient India didn't have a specific word for 'tribe'. They were simply different *janas* living in specific environments like forests.
*   **Current Status:** As of 2011, India has over 700 tribes (approx. 104 million people).

## Cultural Interactions

There has been a constant, fluid exchange between tribal traditions and mainstream schools of thought (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism).

### Mutual Exchange
1.  **Deities:**
    *   **Jagannath** (Puri, Odisha) was originally a tribal deity.
    *   Various forms of the **Mother Goddess** have tribal roots.
    *   Conversely, many tribes adopted Hindu deities and have their own versions of epics like the *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata*.

2.  **Sacred Nature:**
    *   Both tribal and formal Indian traditions regard mountains, rivers, and trees as sacred.
    *   *Example:* The **Toda** tribe of the Nilgiris regards mountain peaks as divine residences and avoids pointing at them.

### Concept of Divinity
Tribal belief systems are often wrongly called "primitive." They possess complex cultures and high philosophical concepts.
*   **Donyipolo:** Worshipped by tribes in Arunachal Pradesh (Sun and Moon combined).
*   **Singbonga:** A supreme creator deity worshipped by Munda and Santhal tribes.
*   **Khandoba:** A deity in central India.
