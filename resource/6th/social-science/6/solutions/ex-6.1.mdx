## Questions, Activities, and Projects

### 1. Why does the civilisation studied in this chapter have several names? Discuss their significance.

**Answer:**
The civilisation is known by multiple names due to the history of its discovery and its geographical extent:
*   **Harappan Civilisation:** It is called this because **Harappa** was the first site to be discovered and excavated (in 1921). In archaeology, a culture is often named after the first site found.
*   **Indus Valley Civilisation:** Initially, sites were found only along the **Indus River** valley (like Mohenjo-daro).
*   **Indus-Sarasvatī Civilisation:** Later research revealed that a vast number of settlements (like Kalibangan and Rakhigarhi) were located along the banks of the dried-up **Sarasvatī River**. This name more accurately reflects the geographical distribution of the population.

### 2. Write a brief report (150 to 200 words) summing up some of the achievements of the Indus-Sarasvatī civilisation.

**Answer:**
**Report: Achievements of the Indus-Sarasvatī Civilisation**

The Indus-Sarasvatī Civilisation (2600–1900 BCE) stands as a testament to early engineering and social organization. Its most remarkable achievement was **Town Planning**. Cities were laid out in a grid pattern with wide streets oriented to cardinal directions. The **Drainage System** was sophisticated, with covered drains running beneath streets, indicating a high regard for hygiene.

In technology, they mastered **Metallurgy** (bronze and copper tools) and **Crafts** (bead-making and shell-cutting). The massive **Dockyard at Lothal** highlights their maritime engineering skills and extensive trade networks.

Agriculturally, they were the first to cultivate **cotton** and built massive water reservoirs (as seen in Dholavira) for conservation. Socially, it appears to have been a relatively peaceful society with no evidence of large standing armies or weapons of mass warfare, focusing instead on trade and civic amenities.

### 3. Imagine you have to travel from the city of Harappa to Kalibangan. What are your different options? Can you make a rough estimation of the amount of time each option might take?

**Answer:**
**Options for Travel:**
1.  **River Travel (Boat):** Harappa is on the Ravi (tributary of Indus) and Kalibangan is on the Sarasvatī. Since these river systems were interconnected or geographically close during the rainy season, one could travel by boat downstream/upstream. This would be the fastest method for cargo.
2.  **Land Travel (Bullock Cart):** For areas not connected by water, bullock carts (terracotta models found) were the primary mode.
3.  **Walking:** For common people without carts.

**Time Estimation:**
The distance is roughly 300-400 km.
*   **Bullock Cart:** At ~15-20 km/day, it would take about **15–20 days**.
*   **Walking:** Similar to carts, perhaps slightly slower depending on the terrain.

### 4. Let us imagine a Harappan man or woman being transported to an average kitchen in today’s India. What are the four or five biggest surprises awaiting them?

**Answer:**
A Harappan would be surprised by:
1.  **Stainless Steel/Plastic:** They used clay (terracotta), copper, or bronze pots. Shiny steel or plastic containers would be alien.
2.  **Running Tap Water:** They fetched water from wells; a tap delivering water instantly would be magical.
3.  **Gas Stove/LPG:** They cooked on firewood or charcoal chulhas. A blue flame appearing from a knob would be surprising.
4.  **New Vegetables:** Potatoes, tomatoes, and chillies (which came to India much later) would be unrecognizable.
5.  **Electricity/Fridge:** Artificial cooling and light without fire.

### 5. Looking at all the pictures in this chapter, make a list of the ornaments / gestures / objects that still feel familiar in our 21st century.

**Answer:**
*   **Ornaments:** Bangles (worn up to the arm, like in Rajasthan/Gujarat), necklaces, beads, anklets.
*   **Gestures:** The "Namaste" pose (seen in terracotta figurines), Yoga postures (Pashupati seal).
*   **Objects:** Combs (ivory/plastic look similar), Dice (for games), Whistles, Bullock carts (still seen in rural India), Earthen pots (matkas).

### 6. What mindset does the system of reservoirs at Dholavira reflect?

**Answer:**
The reservoirs reflect a mindset of **conservation, foresight, and community welfare**.
*   Living in an arid region (Rann of Kutch), they understood the value of every drop of fresh water.
*   The scale suggests a **cooperative effort** or strong leadership dedicated to public goods, ensuring the city could survive droughts.

### 7. In Mohenjo-daro, about 700 wells built with bricks have been counted. They seem to have been regularly maintained and used for several centuries. Discuss the implications.

**Answer:**
*   **Water Security:** 700 wells imply that water was accessible to almost every household or neighborhood, reducing the labor of fetching water from the river.
*   **Independence:** Unlike relying on a single central source, distributed wells gave neighborhoods resilience.
*   **Maintenance Culture:** The fact that they lasted centuries implies regular cleaning (desilting) and brick repair, pointing to a stable social structure and civic duty passed down through generations.

### 8. It is often said that the Harappans had a high civic sense. Discuss the significance of this statement. Do you agree with it? Compare with citizens in a large city of India today.

**Answer:**
**Significance:** "Civic sense" refers to the responsibility citizens feel towards their community and public spaces.
**Agreement:** Yes, the Harappans had high civic sense.
*   **Evidence:** They connected their private drains to public sewers but installed **settling sumps** to prevent solid waste from clogging the main pipes. They did not throw trash in the streets (bins were found). Encroachment on streets was rare.
**Comparison:**
*   Today, many cities struggle with open drains, littering, and encroachment. The Harappans, 4000 years ago, prioritized **sanitation and urban order** more effectively than many modern municipalities, highlighting a disciplined society.
