## Art and Artifacts

Harappan art was realistic and utilitarian. They did not build massive temples or statues of kings, but their small-scale art is exquisite.

### Key Artifacts
1.  **The "Priest King":** A stone statue of a bearded man wearing a shawl with trefoil patterns.
2.  **The "Dancing Girl":** A bronze figurine (approx 10 cm) from Mohenjo-daro. She stands confidently with one hand on her hip, arm covered in bangles.
3.  **Terracotta Toys:** Whistles, carts, birds, and animals, showing that children were well cared for and amused.

### Social Hierarchy
While we don't know if they had "Kings," the society was divided:
*   **Elites:** Lived in the Citadel, used luxury items (carnelian, gold).
*   **Commoners:** Lived in the Lower Town, engaged in agriculture and crafts.

### Religion (Inferred)
*   **Nature Worship:** Trees (Pipal) and animals (Bull, Tiger).
*   **Figures:** Terracotta figurines of women (Mother Goddess?) and the "Pashupati" seal (a deity seated in yoga posture surrounded by animals).
*   **No Temples:** Unlike Egypt/Mesopotamia, no clear temple structures have been found.

**The Script:** The Harappan script remains **undeciphered**. It is written on seals, copper plates, and pots. It was likely written from right to left.
