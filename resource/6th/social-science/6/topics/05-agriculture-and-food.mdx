## Feeding the Cities

The growth of large cities like Harappa was only possible because of a robust agricultural system in the surrounding villages.

### Crops
The Harappan diet was diverse, consisting of:
*   **Cereals:** Wheat, Barley, Millets, and sometimes Rice (found in Lothal/Rangpur).
*   **Pulses:** Lentils, chickpeas, peas.
*   **Others:** Sesame, mustard, and **Cotton** (they were the first in Eurasia to cultivate cotton for cloth).

### Technology
*   **Plough:** Terracotta models of ploughs have been found (e.g., at Banawali), indicating they used bullocks to till the land.
*   **Irrigation:** Evidence of canals (Shortugai) and wells suggests they didn't rely solely on rain.

### Animal Husbandry
*   **Domesticated:** Cattle (humped bull), sheep, goat, buffalo, pig.
*   **Food:** Fish and wild fowl were also consumed.
*   **Scientific Analysis:** Residue analysis of cooking pots has revealed traces of **turmeric, ginger, and banana**, showing a sophisticated palate!

**The Plough:** The invention of the plough was revolutionary. It allowed deeper turning of the soil, bringing nutrients to the surface and significantly increasing crop yields compared to using a simple hoe.
