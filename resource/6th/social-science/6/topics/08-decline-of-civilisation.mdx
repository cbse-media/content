## The End or a New Beginning?

Around **1900 BCE**, the great cities began to decline.
*   Maintenance of drains collapsed.
*   The "Great Bath" was no longer used.
*   Weights and seals disappeared.
*   People abandoned the cities and moved to smaller rural settlements.

### Causes of Decline
Historians reject the theory of "Aryan Invasion" or massive warfare as the primary cause. Instead, environmental factors played the key role:

1.  **Climate Change (2200 BCE):** A global shift led to weaker monsoons and drought.
2.  **Drying of the Sarasvatī:** Tectonic shifts likely diverted the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers away from the Sarasvatī, causing it to dry up. Cities like Kalibangan dependent on it had to be abandoned.
3.  **Ecological Imbalance:** Over-exploitation of resources (deforestation for fuel/bricks) might have damaged the local ecosystem.

### Legacy
Though the cities died, the culture survived. Elements like the "Namaste" gesture, Yoga postures, worship of Shiva-like figures (Pashupati), bangle wearing, and certain craft techniques continued into later Indian traditions.

**Ruralization:** The decline was not an extinction of the people, but a shift from an **urban** lifestyle back to a **rural** one.
