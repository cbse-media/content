## Hygiene and Hydraulics

The Harappans placed immense importance on water and cleanliness. Their hydraulic engineering was centuries ahead of other contemporary civilisations.

### Drainage System
*   **Network:** Houses had separate bathing areas connected to street drains.
*   **Covered Drains:** The main drains running under streets were covered with bricks or stone slabs.
*   **Maintenance:** Manholes were provided at regular intervals for cleaning.
*   **Significance:** This suggests a "civic sense" and a municipal authority responsible for sanitation.

### Sources of Water
1.  **Wells:** Mohenjo-daro alone had about **700 wells**.
2.  **Reservoirs (Dholavira):** Since Dholavira (in the Rann of Kutch) did not have perennial rivers like the Indus, they built massive stone reservoirs to harvest rainwater.
    *   Some reservoirs were cut into solid rock.
    *   The largest measured **73 metres** in length.
    *   Connected by underground drains.

**Dholavira's Uniqueness:** While most Harappan construction used bricks, Dholavira extensively used **stone** for its reservoirs and buildings.
