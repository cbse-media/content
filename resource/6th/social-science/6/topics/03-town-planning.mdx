## A Planned Urban Layout

The most striking feature of the Harappan civilisation was its **town planning**. Unlike the haphazard growth of many modern cities, Harappan cities followed a grid system.

### Structural Features
1.  **Bipartite Layout:** Most cities were divided into two parts:
    *   **Upper Town (Citadel):** Built on a raised platform, often fortified. Likely used by the elite or for public purposes.
    *   **Lower Town:** Larger area where common people lived.
2.  **Streets:** Wide streets oriented to cardinal directions (North-South, East-West), cutting each other at right angles.
3.  **Bricks:** Buildings were made of **baked bricks** of a standardized ratio (1:2:4). The quality of construction was uniform across small and big houses.

### The Great Bath (Mohenjo-daro)
Located in the Citadel of Mohenjo-daro, this structure is a masterpiece of engineering.

*   **Dimensions:** Roughly $12 \text{ m} \times 7 \text{ m}$.
*   **Construction:** Watertight brickwork sealed with natural **bitumen** (tar).
*   **Features:** Steps leading down from two sides, surrounded by rooms (for changing), and a large drain to empty the tank.
*   **Purpose:** Likely used for special **ritual baths** on religious occasions.
