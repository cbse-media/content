# The Beginnings of Indian Civilisation

The **Indus-Sarasvatī Civilisation** (also known as the Harappan Civilisation) represents India's first successful experiment with urban living. Around 4,600 years ago, complex cities emerged in the northwestern part of the Indian Subcontinent, characterized by remarkable town planning, advanced water management, and a peaceful, trade-oriented society.

## Chapter Overview

In this chapter, we will explore:
*   **What defines a civilisation** compared to early societies.
*   **Geography & Timeline:** Where and when did this civilisation flourish?
*   **Urban Engineering:** How did they build cities like Mohenjo-daro and Dholavira?
*   **Economy:** Agriculture, crafts, and international trade.
*   **Culture:** Art, scripts, and daily life.
*   **The Decline:** Why did the cities disappear?
