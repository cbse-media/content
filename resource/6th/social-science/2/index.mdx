# Oceans and Continents

The Earth is often called the "Blue Planet" because nearly three-fourths of its surface is covered by water. This chapter explores the vast expanses of our oceans and the massive landmasses we call continents.

<Callout variant="info">
**The Big Questions:**
1. What are oceans and continents? What are their names and their distribution?
2. In what ways do oceans and continents impact life on Earth, including human life?
