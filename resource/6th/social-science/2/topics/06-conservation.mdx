## Why Oceans Matter
Oceans have deeply impacted humanity throughout history:
- **Migration & Trade:** Used as routes to reach new lands and exchange goods.
- **Food Source:** Provide fish and other seafood.
- **Oxygen:** Produce over $50\%$ of the world's oxygen supply.
- **Culture:** Nourished the myths and legends of coastal civilizations.

## Modern Threats
Human activities are putting the marine environment under severe stress:
1. **Plastic Pollution:** Millions of tonnes of plastic waste are thrown into oceans every year.
2. **Overfishing:** Excessive fishing leads to the decline of marine species.
3. **Chemical Pollution:** Waste from factories and ships.

**World Oceans Day:** Celebrated on **June 8** to remind us of the critical role oceans play and our responsibility to protect them.
