## The Five Oceans

Although the global ocean is a single continuous body of water, it is conventionally divided into five parts:

| Rank | Ocean | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Pacific Ocean** | The largest of all oceans. |
| 2 | **Atlantic Ocean** | The second largest. |
| 3 | **Indian Ocean** | The third largest; bounded by Asia, Africa, and Australia. |
| 4 | **Southern Ocean** | Also known as the Antarctic Ocean; surrounds Antarctica. |
| 5 | **Arctic Ocean** | The smallest ocean, located around the North Pole. |

## Marine Life
The oceans host a rich diversity of life forms, categorized into Flora and Fauna.

- **Marine Flora:** Includes tiny plants called **algae** and various kinds of seaweeds.
- **Marine Fauna:** Consists of thousands of species, including:
    - Colourful fish and coral reefs.
    - Marine mammals like **Dolphins** and **Whales**.
    - Deep-sea creatures adapted to dark, high-pressure environments.

**Did you know?**
More than half of the world's oxygen is produced by the oceans' flora (specifically phytoplankton and algae). This is why oceans are called 'the planet's lungs'.
