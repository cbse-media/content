## Earth from Space

When seen from outer space, the Earth appears mostly blue. This is because most of the Earth's surface is covered with water—almost three-fourths, in fact. This led early astronauts to lovingly call Earth the **'blue planet'**.

**Key Definitions:**
- **Ocean:** The largest water bodies on the globe.
- **Landmass:** A large body of land.
- **Continent:** A large continuous expanse of land.
</Callout>

## The Role of Oceans and Continents
Both play a vital role in shaping the climate of the Earth. They affect:
- Weather patterns
- Plant and animal life (Flora and Fauna)
- Human history and culture

### Cultural Significance
In India, the emblem of the Indian Navy contains the motto *Sam noh Varunah*, which means "Be auspicious to us, O Varuna." Varuṇa is a Vedic deity associated with the oceans and the sky.
