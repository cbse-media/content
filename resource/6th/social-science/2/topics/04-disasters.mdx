## Oceans and Weather
Oceans are the primary source of the Earth's water cycle.
- **Rainfall:** Large masses of clouds form over oceans and bring rain to the continents.
- **Monsoons:** In India, the summer monsoon rains originate in the Indian Ocean. Without these rains, agriculture would suffer.

## Natural Disasters

### 1. Cyclones
Violent storms with extreme rainfall and very strong winds that originate over warm ocean waters. They cause widespread damage to coastal regions.

### 2. Tsunamis
A **Tsunami** is a huge and powerful wave generally caused by a strong earthquake or a volcanic eruption at the bottom of the ocean.

## Disaster Management
To protect lives, countries use **Early Warning Systems**.
- **Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System:** A collaborative network to detect underwater seismic activity.
- **NDMA:** In India, the *National Disaster Management Authority* handles disaster responses.
