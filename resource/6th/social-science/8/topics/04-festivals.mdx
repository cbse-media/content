## The Harvest Celebration

India is a land of festivals. A striking observation is that many festivals are celebrated across the country at the same time but are known by different names. A prime example is the **Harvest Festival** marked around **January 14th**.

### One Event, Many Names

The astronomical event marks the sun's entry into the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara). While the event is the same (**Unity**), the regional celebrations vary (**Diversity**).

| Region / State | Festival Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nationwide / General** | Makara Sankranti |
| **Tamil Nadu** | Pongal |
| **Assam** | Magh Bihu |
| **Punjab / North India** | Lohri / Maghi |
| **Gujarat** | Uttarayan |
| **Karnataka** | Makara Sankramana |
| **Bihar / UP** | Khichdi Parv |
| **West Bengal** | Poush Songkranti |

**Activity:** Compare how *Pongal* involves boiling rice and milk, while *Lohri* involves a bonfire, yet both celebrate the harvest and gratitude towards nature.
