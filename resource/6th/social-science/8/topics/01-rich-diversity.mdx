## The Landscape of Diversity

Traveling through India offers a visual feast of changing landscapes, dresses, food, and scripts. With over **1.4 billion inhabitants** (constituting about 18% of the world's population), such diversity is natural.

### The 'People of India' Project

In the late 20th century, the **Anthropological Survey of India** conducted a massive survey to document this diversity.

*   **Scope:** Covered 4,635 communities across all States.
*   **Linguistic Findings:** Identified **325 languages** using **25 different scripts**.
*   **Migration:** Observed that many Indians are migrants, living away from their original birthplaces or communities.

### Making Sense of the Many

While diversity is beautiful, it can be bewildering. How can a single history be written for such a diverse land? The answer, as noted by British historian **Vincent Smith** over a century ago, lies in the concept of **Unity in Diversity**.

**Definition:**
**Unity in Diversity** implies that despite differences in physical appearance, language, custom, and religion, there is a fundamental bond of humanity and shared cultural history that unites the people of India.
