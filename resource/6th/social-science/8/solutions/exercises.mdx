## Questions, Activities, and Projects

The following are model answers and discussion guides for the exercises found on page 136.

### 1. The Meaning of "Unity in Diversity"

**Question:** Conduct a class discussion on the two quotations at the start of the chapter (Rabindranath Tagore and Sri Aurobindo).

**Discussion Points:**
*   **Tagore's Quote:** *"Oh, grant me my prayer, that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the one in the play of the many."*
    *   **Interpretation:** Tagore sees diversity ("the many") not as chaos, but as a "play" or celebration. He prays to always see the underlying unity ("the one") within this variety. It suggests that enjoying diversity is spiritual.
*   **Aurobindo's Quote:** *"The principle of unity in diversity... would place her on the sure foundation of her Swabhava and Swadharma."*
    *   **Interpretation:** Aurobindo argues that unity in diversity is India's true nature (*Swabhava*). Acknowledging this is essential for India to fulfill its duty or path (*Swadharma*). It is the bedrock of Indian civilization.

### 2. The Panchatantra Today

**Question:** Select a few stories from the *Pañchatantra* and discuss how their message is still valid today. Do you know of any similar stories from your region?

**Model Answer:**
*   **Story Example:** *The Monkey and the Crocodile.*
    *   **Message:** Presence of mind is stronger than brute force; choose friends wisely.
    *   **Relevance Today:** In the modern world, critical thinking and emotional intelligence are often more valuable than physical power. Trusting the wrong people can lead to loss.
*   **Regional Connection:** (Student should answer based on location). *Example:* The Jataka tales in Buddhist tradition often share similar themes of animal wisdom.

### 3. Folk Tales

**Question:** Collect a few folk tales from your region and discuss their message.

**Guidance:**
*   Folk tales are often oral stories passed down by grandparents.
*   **Look for themes:** Respect for nature, the victory of good over evil, or the foolishness of greed.
*   **Example (General):** The story of *Tenali Raman* (South India) or *Akbar-Birbal* (North India) often teaches wit and justice.

### 4. Art and Ancient Stories

**Question:** Is there any ancient story that you have seen being depicted through a form of art? (Sculpture, painting, dance, movie).

**Model Examples:**
*   **Dance:** *Kathakali* (Kerala) or *Yakshagana* (Karnataka) performances often depict scenes from the *Mahabharata*.
*   **Sculpture:** The carvings at Ellora or Mahabalipuram showing the *Descent of the Ganges* or *Arjuna’s Penance*.
*   **Movies:** Films like *Baahubali* (inspired by epic themes) or the animated *Ramayana*.
*   **Festivals:** The *Ramlila* performed during Dussehra is a theatrical depiction of the *Ramayana*.

### 5. Nehru's Observation

**Question:** Discuss the quotation by Jawaharlal Nehru: *"Everywhere I found a cultural background which had exerted a powerful influence on their lives... The old epics... were widely known among the masses..."*

**Analysis:**
*   **Cultural Literacy:** Nehru observed that even illiterate villagers knew the *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* by heart.
*   **Education via Culture:** People didn't need formal schooling to learn ethics; they learned "what is right and wrong" through these stories.
*   **Unity:** This shared knowledge of epics created a common mental language for all Indians, connecting the villager to the scholar.
