## The Indian Constitution

The identity of modern India is legally defined in its supreme law, the Constitution, which came into force in **1950**.

### Article 1
Right at the beginning, the Constitution addresses the dual names of the country:

<Callout variant="info">
**Article 1(1):** "India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States."
</Callout>

In the Hindi version of the Constitution, it is written as:
> **‘Bhārat arthāth India’**

### Why two names?
The inclusion of both names represents a bridge between:
1.  **Bharat:** Rooted in ancient history, Sanskrit literature, and cultural heritage.
2.  **India:** The name by which the country became known globally in modern times.

**Definition - Constitution:** A document that spells out the basic principles and laws of a nation.
</Callout>

### Historical Context
As seen in the original manuscript of the Constitution (Fig. 5.5 in the text), the opening lines specify the territory and name of the Union, ensuring that the ancient legacy of *Bhārat* is preserved alongside the modern identity of *India*.
