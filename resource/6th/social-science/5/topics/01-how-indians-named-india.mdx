## Ancient Names in Literature

Ancient Indian texts do not just provide names but also describe the geography of the subcontinent.

### 1. Sapta Sindhava
The **Ṛig Veda**, India’s most ancient text (several thousand years old), refers to the northwest region as **'Sapta Sindhava'**, meaning the **'land of the seven rivers'**.
- The name is derived from **'Sindhu'**, which refers to the Indus River.

### 2. Bhāratavarṣha and Jambudvīpa
The **Mahābhārata** and later texts use terms that encompass the entire subcontinent:

- **Bhāratavarṣha:** Means "the country of the Bharatas." The *Bharatas* were a prominent Vedic group of people mentioned first in the Rig Veda.
- **Jambudvīpa:** Means "the island of the fruit of the jamun tree" (Indian Blackberry). Emperor Ashoka (c. 250 BCE) used this name in his inscriptions to describe his empire, which included modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and parts of Afghanistan.

### 3. The Definition in the Viṣhṇu Purāṇa
The *Viṣhṇu Purāṇa* provides a clear geographical definition of the land:

> *"uttaram yat samudrasya himādreścaiva"*
> *"dakṣiṇam varṣam tad bhāratam nāma ..."*

> "The country that lies north of the ocean and south of the snowy mountains is called Bhārata."
