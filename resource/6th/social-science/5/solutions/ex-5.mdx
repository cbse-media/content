### 3. Creative Thinking
**Question:** If you were born some 2,000 years ago and had the chance to name our country, what name or names might you have chosen, and why?

**Answer:** *(Student's imagination)*
*Example:* "I might have named it **'Nadi-Matruka'** (Land Mothered by Rivers) because life in ancient times revolved entirely around the great river systems like the Sindhu, Ganga, and Sarasvati which provided water, transport, and fertile soil."
