## Introduction

The surface of our planet is not uniform. From the towering heights of the Himalayas to the vast, flat stretches of the Indo-Gangetic plains, Earth features diverse physical shapes known as **landforms**. These features take millions of years to form and significantly influence the climate, flora, fauna, and human lifestyles of a region.
