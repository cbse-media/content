## What is a Plateau?

A **plateau** is an elevated flat-topped landform. It is like a "tableland" that rises sharply above the surrounding area on at least one side.

### Key Examples
*   **Tibetan Plateau:** The largest and highest in the world. It stretches nearly 2,500 km from east to west.
*   **Deccan Plateau:** Located in India, it is one of the oldest plateaus, formed by volcanic activity millions of years ago.

## Economic Significance

Plateaus are often called the **"Storehouses of Minerals"**. Because of their geological history, they contain huge deposits of valuable resources:
*   **African Plateau:** Famous for gold and diamonds.
*   **Chhota Nagpur Plateau (India):** Rich in iron, coal, and manganese.

## Features of Plateaus

1.  **Soil Quality:** Most plateaus have rocky, less fertile soil. However, **lava plateaus** (formed from volcanoes) have rich black soil which is excellent for farming.
2.  **Waterfalls:** Since plateaus have steep edges, rivers falling over these edges create spectacular waterfalls.
    *   **Victoria Falls:** Zambezi River (Africa).
    *   **Jog Falls:** Sharavati River (Karnataka, India).
    *   **Hundru Falls:** Subarnarekha River (Jharkhand, India).
    *   **Nohkalikai Falls:** Cherrapunji Plateau (Meghalaya, India).

<Callout variant="info">
The **Deccan Plateau** was formed by volcanic eruptions where lava spread over vast areas and cooled down to form thick layers of rock.
