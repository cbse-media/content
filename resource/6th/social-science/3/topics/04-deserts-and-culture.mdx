## Deserts: The Dry Expanses

Deserts are landforms with very little precipitation. They can be categorized into two types:

1.  **Hot Deserts:** High temperatures (e.g., Sahara in Africa, Thar in India).
2.  **Cold Deserts:** Freezing temperatures (e.g., Gobi in Asia, Antarctica).

Despite the harsh conditions, humans have shown great **resilience**, adapting to these environments through unique cultural traditions, folk songs, and nomadic lifestyles.

## Ancient Perspectives: The Tamil Tiṇais

Ancient Indian culture had its own way of classifying land. In Tamil Sangam poetry, landscapes were divided into five **tiṇais**, each associated with a specific lifestyle and occupation.

### The Five Tiṇais

| Tiṇai | Landscape | Main Occupation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kuriñji** | Mountainous regions | Hunting and gathering |
| **Mullai** | Grassland and forests | Cattle rearing |
| **Marudam** | Fertile agricultural plains | Farming |
| **Neydal** | Coastal regions | Fishing and seafaring |
| **Pālai** | Arid, desert-like regions | Journeying and fighting |

These classifications show that even 2,000 years ago, people deeply understood the connection between the type of land and the way humans live.
