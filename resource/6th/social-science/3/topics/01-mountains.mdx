## Characteristics of Mountains

Mountains are landforms significantly higher than the surrounding landscape. They are typically characterized by:
*   A **broad base**.
*   **Steep slopes**.
*   A **narrow summit** (peak).

### Mountains vs. Hills
While both are elevations, **hills** are generally lower in height, have less steep slopes, and possess rounded tops compared to mountains.

### Mountain Ages
*   **Young Mountains:** These have tall, sharp peaks (e.g., The Himalayas).
*   **Old Mountains:** These are shorter and more rounded due to millions of years of erosion (e.g., The Aravalli Range).

## Mountain Ecosystems

As altitude increases, the temperature drops, leading to distinct zones of life:

1.  **Montane Forests:** Lower slopes are covered with conifers like pines, firs, spruce, and deodar. These trees are tall and cone-shaped with needle-like leaves to allow snow to slide off.
2.  **High Altitude Vegetation:** At very high altitudes, trees disappear, giving way to grasses, **mosses**, and **lichens**.
3.  **Fauna:** Animals adapted to cold and rugged terrain include the Snow Leopard, Yak, Ibex, Himalayan Tahr, and Golden Eagle.

## Life in the Mountains

Mountain life is beautiful but challenging.

*   **Terrace Farming:** Because of steep slopes, farmers cut "steps" into the mountainside to create flat land for crops.
*   **Occupations:** Tourism, herding, and pilgrimages are major sources of income.
*   **Natural Hazards:** People must be resilient against:
    *   **Avalanches:** Sudden falls of snow/ice.
    *   **Landslides:** Collapse of earth or rock.
    *   **Cloudbursts:** Sudden, violent rainstorms leading to **flash floods**.

**Cultural Connection:** Great poets like Kalidasa have celebrated the Himalayas, calling them the "Lord of Mountains" and a "living god" in works like *Kumarasambhava*.
