## What is Democracy?

The word **democracy** comes from two Greek words:
*   *Dēmos* = People
*   *Kratos* = Rule or Power

Literally, it means **"Rule of the People."** It is a system where the citizens have a say in the decisions that affect their lives.

### Types of Democracy

#### 1. Direct Democracy
In this system, every citizen participates directly in decision-making.
*   **Example:** A class voting on where to go for a picnic. If 20 students raise hands for Place A and 10 for Place B, Place A wins. Every student's opinion is counted directly.

#### 2. Representative Democracy
In large countries like India (with 1.4 billion people), it is impossible for everyone to meet and vote on every single decision. Instead, people elect **representatives** to make decisions on their behalf.
*   **MLAs (Members of Legislative Assembly):** Elected at the State level.
*   **MPs (Members of Parliament):** Elected at the National level.
*   **Process:** Through elections, citizens vote for candidates. These elected members meet in assemblies to debate and pass laws.

**Grassroots Democracy:**
This refers to a system that encourages the participation of ordinary citizens at the lowest level (the "grassroots"), ensuring that even the common person has a voice in governance.

### Democracy in India
India is the world's largest democracy. In 2024, there were approximately **970 million voters**.
*   **Universal Adult Franchise:** All Indian citizens above the age of 18 have the right to participate in elections.
*   **Role of Dialogue:** Democracy is not just about voting; it is about discussion, debate, and convincing others to reach the best solution.
