## Introduction

Human beings have lived in communities for a long time. When many people live together, disagreements and disorder can arise. To maintain order and harmony in society, rules become necessary.

Think about your daily life:
*   **Home:** You follow simple rules set by your parents.
*   **School:** Students and teachers follow specific rules.
*   **Traffic:** Drivers must obey traffic signals to avoid accidents.

**The Big Question:** What would happen if no one followed these rules?
**Answer:** Society would not be able to function, leading to chaos and confusion.

### What is Governance?

The process of managing a society involves making decisions, creating rules, and ensuring they are followed.

*   **Governance:** The process of taking decisions, organizing society's life with different sets of rules, and ensuring that they are followed.
*   **Government:** The group of individuals or the system that makes the rules and ensures they are followed.
*   **Laws:** Some of the most important rules that are legally enforceable are called laws.

### Why do rules change?

Rules are not set in stone forever. Just as you might negotiate a rule at home or students might ask a school principal to change a regulation, citizens in a society also have a say in the laws governing them.
