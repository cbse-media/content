## Questions, Activities, and Projects

### Q1. Test yourself — What is the meaning of democracy? What is the difference between direct democracy and representative democracy?

**Answer:**
**Meaning of Democracy:**
Democracy means "Rule of the People" (derived from Greek *dēmos* and *kratos*). It is a system of governance where citizens have the power to participate in decision-making, either directly or through representatives.

**Difference between Direct and Representative Democracy:**

| Feature | Direct Democracy | Representative Democracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Every citizen participates directly in making decisions. | Citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. |
| **Suitability** | Suitable for small groups (e.g., a classroom or a small village meeting). | Essential for large populations (e.g., a country like India). |
| **Example** | A class voting on a picnic destination by raising hands. | Citizens voting to elect MPs and MLAs who then make laws in Parliament/Assemblies. |

**Answer:**
The three organs of government and their roles are:

1.  **Legislature (Law-Making Body):**
    *   **Role:** To make, modify, or remove laws.
    *   **Structure:** Consists of elected representatives (e.g., Parliament at the Centre, Legislative Assemblies in States).
2.  **Executive (Implementing Body):**
    *   **Role:** To implement (execute) the laws made by the legislature and maintain law and order.
    *   **Structure:** Includes the President, Prime Minister, Ministers, and administrative officers (police, IAS, etc.).
3.  **Judiciary (Justice System):**
    *   **Role:** To interpret laws, settle disputes, punish those who break the law, and ensure fairness.
    *   **Structure:** Consists of courts (Supreme Court, High Courts, Lower Courts).

### Q3. Why do we need three tiers of government?

**Answer:**
We need three tiers of government (Local, State, and National) for the following reasons:
1.  **Size and Population:** In a vast country like India, it is impossible for a single central government to manage the specific needs of every village and town effectively.
2.  **Efficiency:** Local problems (like water supply or garbage) are best understood and solved by local people/government. Regional issues (like state police or agriculture) are handled by the State. National issues (like defense or currency) require a central authority.
3.  **Decentralization:** It distributes power so that governance reaches the grassroots level, allowing ordinary citizens to participate more effectively in democracy.
