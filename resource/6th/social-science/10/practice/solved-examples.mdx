## Scenario 1: The Cybercrime Case
*Referenced from the "Three Organs of Government" section.*

**Question:** A group of criminals is stealing money online. Explain how the three organs of government intervene in this situation.

**Solution:**
1.  **The Legislature:** It must have previously passed a law (e.g., The Information Technology Act) that defines online theft as a crime and sets a punishment for it. Without this law, the act cannot be legally prosecuted.
2.  **The Executive:** The Cyber Police (part of the Executive) investigates the crime, tracks the digital footprint, and arrests the criminals. The prosecutors (lawyers for the state) present the case.
3.  **The Judiciary:** The case is brought to court. The judge hears the evidence from the police and the defense from the criminals. If found guilty, the Judiciary sentences them to jail or imposes a fine based on the law.

## Scenario 2: The Broken Streetlight
*Referenced from the "Three Levels of Government" section.*

**Question:** The streetlight in front of your house has stopped working. You need to get it fixed. Which level of government would you approach and why?

**Solution:**
You would approach the **Local Government** (Municipal Corporation in a city or Gram Panchayat in a village).
*   **Reason:** The Central Government handles national issues (like defense), and the State Government handles regional issues (like highways). Maintenance of local amenities like streetlights, garbage collection, and local water supply falls under the jurisdiction of the Local Government.

## Scenario 3: The Picnic Vote
*Referenced from the "Democracy" section.*

**Question:** A class of 40 students needs to decide the colour of their class T-shirt. 25 students vote for Blue, 10 for Red, and 5 for Green.
1.  Which colour wins?
2.  What type of democracy is this?

**Solution:**
1.  **Winner:** Blue wins because it received the majority of votes (25 out of 40).
2.  **Type:** This is an example of **Direct Democracy**. Every member of the community (the class) directly expressed their opinion, and the decision was made based on the direct count of these opinions, rather than electing a representative to choose the colour for them.
