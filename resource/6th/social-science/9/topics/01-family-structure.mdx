## What is a Family?

The family is the fundamental unit of society. While every family is unique, they generally fall into two broad categories in Indian society today.

### Types of Families

1.  **Joint Family:**
    *   Consists of several generations living together.
    *   **Members:** Grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters, and cousins.
    *   **Characteristics:** Shared resources, collective decision-making, and close bonding across generations.

2.  **Nuclear Family:**
    *   A smaller unit.
    *   **Members:** Limited to a couple and their children (or sometimes a single parent and children).
    *   **Characteristics:** Often seen in cities or where jobs require moving away from the ancestral home.

### Kinship Terms (Language Connection)

In English, family terms are often general (e.g., "Uncle" or "Cousin"). However, Indian languages have very specific terms that define the exact relationship.

**Did You Know?**
Most Indian languages do not have a word for "Cousin". Cousins are referred to as brothers and sisters, emphasising the deep bond between them.

**Examples in Hindi:**
| Name | Relationship | Term in Hindi |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bua** | Father's sister | बुआ |
| **Chacha** | Father's younger brother | चाचा |
| **Mama** | Mother's brother | मामा |
| **Nana/Nani** | Maternal Grandparents | नाना / नानी |

This linguistic specificity reflects the importance of extended family relationships in Indian culture.
