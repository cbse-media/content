## 1. Halma: The Bhil Tradition
**Location:** Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh.

*   **The Problem:** Acute water crisis.
*   **The Tradition:** *Halma* — coming together to help an individual or the community during a crisis without payment.
*   **The Action:** The Bhil community planted thousands of trees and dug trenches to conserve rainwater.
*   **Result:** Restoration of the environment. Shri Mahesh Sharma was honoured with the Padma Shri for leading this Shivganga movement.
*   **Value:** Serving "Mother Earth" as a duty.

## 2. Chennai Floods (2015)
**Context:** An urban disaster where roads turned to rivers.

*   **Community Response:** People could not move, shops were closed. Religious and private groups cooked large quantities of food and distributed it to strangers.
*   **Lesson:** In times of crisis, community barriers break down, and humanity serves as one community.

## 3. Kamal Parmar's Initiative
**Location:** Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

*   **The Individual:** Kamal Parmar, an auto-fabrication workshop owner.

    *   School teachers joined to teach for free.
    *   Older students became volunteers.
