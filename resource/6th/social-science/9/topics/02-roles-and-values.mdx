## Roles and Responsibilities

Relationships in a family are based on love, care, cooperation, and interdependence.
*   **Cooperation:** Means "working together".
*   **Interdependence:** Members rely on each other for emotional, financial, and physical support.

As children grow, they take on more responsibility, helping with chores and participating in the life of the household.

### The Family as a School of Values

The family is often called the first "school" where children learn essential Indian cultural values.

1.  **Dharma (Duty):** Doing one's duty towards the family and society.
2.  **Ahimsa:** Non-violence and gentleness.
3.  **Dana (Giving):** Generosity and sharing resources.
4.  **Seva (Service):** Serving others without expectation.
5.  **Tyaga (Sacrifice):** Giving up personal needs for the greater good of the family.
