## Exemplary Leadership

The effectiveness of a Panchayat often depends on the vision of its Sarpanch. Here are three inspiring examples of leadership transforming rural India.

### 1. Dnyaneshwar Kamble (Solapur, Maharashtra)
*   **Profile:** A transgender person elected as Sarpanch in 2017.
*   **Motto:** *Lok seva, gram seva* (Service to the village is service to the public).
*   **Achievement:** Defeated six other candidates, proving that service matters more than gender identity.

### 2. Vandana Bahadur Maida (Madhya Pradesh)
*   **Profile:** A member of the Bhil community.
*   **Achievement:** Defied patriarchal norms to become the first female Sarpanch of Khankhandvi village.
*   **Impact:** convinced women to attend Sabha meetings and addressed critical issues like education and sanitation.

### 3. Popatrao Baguji Pawar (Hiware Bazar, Maharashtra)
*   **Challenge:** The village suffered from frequent droughts and poor agricultural yield.

## Child-Friendly Panchayat Initiative

Panchayats are not just for adults. The **Child-Friendly Panchayat Initiative** creates opportunities for children to express their opinions on matters concerning their well-being.

### Bal Sabhas & Bal Panchayats
In States like Maharashtra, children participate in **Bal Sabhas** (Children's Assemblies).
*   **Goal:** To solve issues like child labor and child marriage.
*   **Action:** Convincing parents to send children back to school.

### Case Study: Sangkhu Radhu Khandu (Sikkim)
This Gram Panchayat in West Sikkim prioritized children's needs:
*   Built compound walls for schools (safety).
*   Constructed kitchens for hygienic midday meals.
*   **Result:** Declared a "Child-Friendly Gram Panchayat".

### Case Study: The Children’s Parliament (Rajasthan)
An offshoot of the 'Barefoot College' initiative:
*   **Participants:** Children aged 8–14.
*   **Structure:** Followed formal procedures (elections, voter IDs, Cabinet).
*   **Impact:** Children managed schools and advocated for community needs, fostering leadership and social responsibility.

**Think About It:** Why is it important for a village council to listen to children? Children often raise issues that adults might overlook, such as school safety or playground maintenance.
