## Beyond the Village

While the Gram Panchayat handles village-level issues, larger projects require coordination at higher levels. This is where the **Block** and **District** levels come in.

### 1. Panchayat Samiti (Block Level)

The **Panchayat Samiti** (also called Block Panchayat or Mandal Parishad) acts as the **link** between the Gram Panchayat and the Zila Parishad.

*   **Structure:** It covers a block consisting of many villages.
*   **Membership:**
    *   Elected members.
    *   Sarpanchs of villages in the area.
    *   Local Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).
*   **Key Function:**
    *   Coordinate matters across multiple Gram Panchayats.
    *   Collect development plans from villages and consolidate them for the District level.

### 2. Zila Parishad (District Level)

The **Zila Parishad** (District Panchayat) is the apex body of the Panchayati Raj system.

*   **Key Function:**
    *   Facilitates the allotment of funds for development projects.
    *   Manages government schemes like the **Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana** (PMGSY), which promotes the construction of all-weather roads.
    *   Oversees the development of the entire district.

### Representation and Inclusivity

At all three levels (Village, Block, District), special rules ensure that disadvantaged sections of society are heard.

**Reservation for Women:** There is a mandatory provision for reserving **one-third** of the seats for women in these institutions to ensure their active participation in governance.
