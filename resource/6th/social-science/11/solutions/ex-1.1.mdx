## Questions, Activities, and Projects

### 1. Test Yourself
**Question:** Without looking at the text above, can you name the three tiers of the Panchayati Raj system? What are the key functions of each of the three tiers?

**Answer:**
The three tiers of the Panchayati Raj system are:

1.  **Gram Panchayat (Village Level):**
    *   **Function:** Handles local issues like water, sanitation, school maintenance, and dispute resolution. Implements development schemes at the village level.
2.  **Panchayat Samiti (Block Level):**
    *   **Function:** Acts as a link between the Village and District levels. Coordinates development plans across multiple villages and consolidates them.
3.  **Zila Parishad (District Level):**
    *   **Function:** Oversees the development of the entire district. Facilitates fund allotment and manages large-scale government schemes like road construction.

### 2. Letter to the Sarpanch
**Activity:** Write a letter to the Sarpanch regarding the issue of plastic bags lying on the roadside in the village.

**Sample Draft:**

> **To,**
> **The Sarpanch,**
> Gram Panchayat [Village Name],
> [District Name].
>
> **Subject:** Request to address the issue of plastic waste on roadsides.
>
> **Respected Sir/Madam,**
>
> I am a resident of Ward No. 4 of our village. I am writing to bring to your kind attention the increasing problem of plastic bags lying scattered on the main roadside near the school and the market area.
>
> These plastic bags are not only making our village look dirty but are also choking the drains, leading to water stagnation and bad smell. Cows and other stray animals often eat these bags, which is dangerous for their health.
>
> I request the Gram Panchayat to organize a cleanliness drive and install dustbins at key locations. We can also conduct an awareness campaign to encourage villagers to use cloth bags instead of plastic.
>
> I am willing to volunteer for any such initiative taken by the Panchayat.
>
> **Yours sincerely,**
> [Your Name]
> [Date]

### 3. Ideal Panchayat Member
**Question:** In your view, what type of person should be a Gram Panchayat member?

**Discussion Points:**
An ideal Gram Panchayat member should possess the following qualities:
*   **Accessible:** They should be easy to approach for any villager.
*   **Honest & Transparent:** They should handle public funds with integrity.
*   **Inclusive:** They should listen to everyone, including women, children, and disadvantaged communities, not just the wealthy or powerful.
*   **Proactive:** Instead of waiting for complaints, they should actively look for problems to solve (like repairing a broken tap before it floods).
*   **Visionary:** Like Sarpanch Popatrao Pawar, they should have a long-term vision for the village's environment and prosperity.

### 4. Problem Solving: Highway Safety
**Scenario:** You study in a village school located next to a highway. Students find it difficult to cross the road.
*   **What are the options to solve this issue?**
*   **Which institutions in the Panchayati Raj can help?**
*   **What can the students do?**

**Solution Strategy:**

1.  **Options to solve the issue:**
    *   Construction of a speed breaker or rumble strips near the school.
    *   Installation of "School Ahead" or "Go Slow" signboards.
    *   Construction of a zebra crossing or a foot-over bridge (for very busy highways).
    *   Deploying a traffic volunteer during school start and end times.

2.  **Institutions that can help:**
    *   **Gram Panchayat:** The first point of contact. They can pass a resolution demanding safety measures.
    *   **Zila Parishad:** Since highways are often managed at a higher level or involve the Public Works Department (PWD), the Gram Panchayat will escalate this to the **Zila Parishad** to get funds or permission for speed breakers.

3.  **What can students do?**
    *   Form a student group or use the **Bal Panchayat** to draft a petition.
    *   Present the petition to the Headmaster and the Sarpanch.
    *   Organize a safety awareness campaign to teach younger students how to cross carefully until the infrastructure is fixed.
