## Classification of Economic Sectors

Economic activities are diverse, but many share similar characteristics. Based on these similarities, we group them into three main **Economic Sectors**:
1.  **Primary Sector**
2.  **Secondary Sector**
3.  **Tertiary Sector**

This classification helps us understand the economic structure and prosperity of a nation.

## A. Primary Activities

The **Primary Sector** includes all economic activities where people are **directly dependent on nature** to produce goods. It is called "primary" because it forms the base for all other products that we subsequently make.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Source:** Direct extraction or utilization of natural resources.
*   **Nature:** Usually involves biological processes (plants/animals) or geological processes (mining).
*   **Output:** Raw materials (e.g., cotton, iron ore, wheat, milk).

### Common Examples

| Activity | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Agriculture** | Cultivation of grains, vegetables, and fruits. |
| **Livestock Rearing** | Raising animals for milk, eggs, wool, or meat (e.g., dairy farming, poultry). |
| **Forestry** | Collecting wood, timber, or other forest produce. |
| **Fishing** | Catching fish from rivers, lakes, or oceans. |
| **Mining** | Extracting minerals like coal, iron ore, or petroleum from the earth. |

**Think About It:**
When a farmer grows cotton, it is a primary activity because the growth of the cotton plant depends mainly on natural factors like rainfall, sunshine, and climate.
