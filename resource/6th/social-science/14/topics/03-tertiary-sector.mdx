## C. Tertiary Activities

The **Tertiary Sector**, also known as the **Service Sector**, consists of activities that provide support to the Primary and Secondary sectors. These activities do not produce a physical good (like wheat or a car) but provide a **service** that helps in the production or distribution process.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Support:** Facilitates the functioning of the other two sectors.
*   **Intangible:** You cannot "hold" a service like you hold a product, but you experience its value.
*   **Skill-based:** Often requires specialized skills (e.g., doctors, pilots, coders).

<Callout variant="tip">
**Role:** Activities involved in the provision of services which complement both primary and secondary sectors.

### Categories of Tertiary Activities

1.  **Trade and Logistics:**
    *   **Transportation:** Trucks, trains, ships, and planes moving goods from farms to factories and then to markets.
    *   **Warehousing:** Large buildings used to store goods before they are sold.
    *   **Retail:** Shops, vegetable vendors, and malls selling goods to consumers.

2.  **Professional Services:**
    *   Doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers.
    *   Technicians repairing mobiles, mechanics fixing cars.

3.  **Financial & Communication Services:**
    *   **Banking:** Managing money for businesses and individuals.
    *   **Communication:** Internet services, mobile networks, software development.
    *   **Hospitality:** Hotels and restaurants.

### How it Connects

Imagine a farmer grows tomatoes (Primary).
1.  **Transport:** A truck driver (Tertiary) takes them to a factory.
2.  **Factory:** The factory makes ketchup (Secondary).
3.  **Advertising/Sales:** A marketing team (Tertiary) advertises it, and a shopkeeper (Tertiary) sells it to you.

Without the Tertiary sector, the tomatoes might rot on the farm, and the ketchup would never reach your table.
