## Introduction

In previous chapters, we learned to distinguish between **economic** and **non-economic** activities. Activities that create **monetary value** are called economic activities.

To understand the economy better, we classify these diverse activities—ranging from farming to software development—into specific groups called **sectors**. This chapter explores how these sectors function, how they are different, and how they rely on each other to bring prosperity to a nation.

**Definition: Monetary Value**
The value of something that can be measured in terms of money. Activities generating this value are the root of economic growth.
