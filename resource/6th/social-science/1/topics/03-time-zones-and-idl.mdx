## Why does Time Change?
As the Earth rotates from **West to East**, different longitudes face the Sun at different times.

### The Math of Time
The Earth completes a $360^\circ$ rotation in 24 hours.
- $360^\circ \div 24 \text{ hours} = 15^\circ \text{ per hour}$.
- Therefore, $1^\circ$ change in longitude = **4 minutes**.

## Local Time vs. Standard Time
- **Local Time:** Determined by the position of the Sun at a specific longitude.
- **Standard Time:** A uniform time adopted by a country to avoid confusion.

### Indian Standard Time (IST)
India uses the $82.5^\circ \text{E}$ longitude as its standard meridian.
- IST is **5 hours 30 minutes ahead** of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

$$
\text{Time difference} = 82.5^\circ \times 4 \text{ min} = 330 \text{ min} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
$$

## International Date Line (IDL)
The IDL is located approximately at $180^\circ$ longitude.
- Crossing it from **East to West**: Add a day (Sunday becomes Monday).
- Crossing it from **West to East**: Subtract a day (Monday becomes Sunday).

<Callout variant="warning">
The International Date Line is not a straight line. It zig-zags to avoid crossing through countries, so that a single country doesn't have two different dates at the same time!
