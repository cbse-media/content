## Logic Practice: Time Calculation

**Question:** If it is 10:00 AM at the Prime Meridian ($0^\circ$), what is the local time at $30^\circ \text{W}$?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. **Identify Longitude Difference:** $30^\circ - 0^\circ = 30^\circ$.
2. **Convert to Time:** $15^\circ = 1$ hour, so $30^\circ = 2$ hours.
3. **Determine Direction:** $30^\circ \text{W}$ is to the West of the Prime Meridian.
4. **Calculate:** In the West, time is "behind."
   $$10:00 \text{ AM} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8:00 \text{ AM}$$.

**Answer:** The local time is 8:00 AM.
