## Introduction

In this chapter, we explore how humans represent the Earth and locate specific points on its surface. From simple city maps to the global grid of latitudes and longitudes, we learn the tools that make navigation and time-keeping possible.

### Why Social Science?
Before diving into geography, it is important to understand that Social Science is the study of human society. It helps us:
- Understand the world and our place in it.
- Learn how to live in peace and harmony.
- Protect our planet for future generations.

<Callout variant="info">
**The Multidisciplinary Approach:** Social Science is not just one subject. It combines History, Geography, Political Science, Economics, and more to provide a holistic view of human life.

## Chapter Summary

### Key Components of Maps
1. **Distance (Scale):** Relates distance on the map to actual distance on the ground.
2. **Direction:** Uses cardinal points (N, S, E, W) and intermediate directions (NE, SE, SW, NW).
3. **Symbols:** Representations of real-world features like roads, rivers, and buildings.

### The Global Grid
- **Latitudes:** Imaginary horizontal lines parallel to the Equator ($0^\circ$).
- **Longitudes:** Imaginary vertical lines (meridians) running from the North Pole to the South Pole.
- **Coordinates:** The intersection of a latitude and a longitude that defines a precise location.

## Quick Formula Sheet

$$
\text{Map Scale Ratio} = \frac{\text{Distance on Map}}{\text{Distance on Ground}}
$$

$$
1^\circ \text{ Longitude} = 4 \text{ minutes of time}
$$

$$
15^\circ \text{ Longitude} = 1 \text{ hour of time}
$$

$$
\text{Total Longitude} = 360^\circ \text{ (Full Rotation in 24 hours)}
$$
