## Section 1.5: Patterns in Shapes

**Q1. Can you recognise the pattern in each of the sequences in Table 3?**

**Answer:**
1.  **Regular Polygons:**
    *   Sequence of Sides: $3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \dots$ (Counting numbers starting at 3).
2.  **Complete Graphs:**
    *   Sequence of Lines: $1, 3, 6, 10, 15 \dots$ (Triangular numbers).
3.  **Stacked Squares:**
    *   Sequence of small squares: $1, 4, 9, 16 \dots$ (Square numbers).
4.  **Stacked Triangles:**
    *   Sequence of small triangles: $1, 4, 9, 16 \dots$ (Square numbers).
5.  **Koch Snowflake:**
    *   Sequence of sides: $3, 12, 48 \dots$ ($3 \times 4^n$).

**Q2. Try and redraw each sequence... Can you draw the next shape?**

**Answer:**
*   **Regular Polygons:** The next shape is a **Regular Hendecagon** (11 sides).
*   **Complete Graphs:** The next graph is **K6** (6 points). It will have 15 lines.
