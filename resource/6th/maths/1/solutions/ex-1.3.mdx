## Section 1.3: Visualising Number Sequences

**Q2. Why are 1, 3, 6, 10... called triangular numbers? Why are 1, 4, 9... called square numbers? Why are 1, 8, 27... called cubes?**

**Answer:**
*   They are called **Triangular Numbers** because that specific number of dots can be arranged to form a perfect equilateral triangle.
*   They are called **Square Numbers** because the dots can form a perfect square grid with equal rows and columns.
*   They are called **Cubes** because unit blocks of that quantity can form a solid 3D cube ($2\times2\times2=8$, etc.).

**Q3. You will have noticed that 36 is both a triangular number and a square number!**

**Answer:**
*   **As a Square:** $6 \times 6 = 36$.
*   **As a Triangle:** Sum of $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36$.

**Q4. What would you call the following sequence of numbers: 1, 7, 19, 37...?**

**Answer:**
These are called **Hexagonal Numbers**.
*   **Next Number:** The pattern of differences is multiples of 6 ($+6, +12, +18$). The next difference is $+24$.
*   $37 + 24 = \mathbf{61}$.

**Q5. Can you think of pictorial ways to visualise the sequence of Powers of 2? Powers of 3?**

**Answer:**
*   **Powers of 2 ($1, 2, 4, 8$):** Can be visualized as a line branching into 2, then those branching into 2 (Binary Tree), or identifying dimensions (Point, Line, Square, Cube corners).
*   **Powers of 3 ($1, 3, 9, 27$):** Can be visualized as a triangle splitting into 3 smaller triangles, or a tree where every branch splits into three.
