## Section 1.6: Relation to Number Sequences

**Q1. Count the number of sides and corners in Regular Polygons.**

**Answer:**
*   **Sides:** $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \dots$
*   **Corners:** $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \dots$
*   **Conclusion:** In any closed polygon, Number of Sides = Number of Corners.

**Q2. Count the number of lines in Complete Graphs.**

**Answer:**
*   The sequence is **1, 3, 6, 10, 15...**
*   This is the **Triangular Number** sequence.
*   **Why?** To draw a complete graph with $n$ points, each new point connects to all previous points. When you add the 3rd point, you draw 2 new lines. When you add the 4th point, you draw 3 new lines. This is adding counting numbers ($1 + 2 + 3 + \dots$).

**Q3. How many little squares are in the Stacked Squares sequence?**

**Answer:**
*   Sequence: **1, 4, 9, 16, 25...**
*   This is the **Square Number** sequence.

**Q4. How many little triangles are in the Stacked Triangles sequence?**

**Answer:**
*   Sequence: **1, 4, 9, 16, 25...**
*   This is also the **Square Number** sequence!
*   **Explanation:** In row 1, there is 1 triangle. In row 2, there are 3 triangles. In row 3, there are 5. Summing these rows ($1 + 3 + 5$) is the "Sum of Odd Numbers" rule, which creates Square Numbers.

**Q5. How many total line segments are there in each shape of the Koch Snowflake?**

**Answer:**
*   **Shape 1 (Triangle):** 3 segments.
*   **Shape 2:** Each of the 3 segments gets a "bump", turning 1 segment into 4. Total = $3 \times 4 = 12$.
*   **Shape 3:** Each of the 12 segments turns into 4. Total = $12 \times 4 = 48$.
*   **Sequence:** $3, 12, 48, 192, 768 \dots$
