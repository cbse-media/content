## Shape Sequences

Just as we have patterns in numbers, we have patterns in shapes. This is the foundation of **Geometry**.

### 1. Regular Polygons
A **regular polygon** is a shape with equal-length sides and equal angles. The sequence starts with 3 sides.

| Sides | Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| 3 | Equilateral Triangle |
| 4 | Square |
| 5 | Regular Pentagon |
| 6 | Regular Hexagon |
| 7 | Regular Heptagon |

The number of sides follows the **Counting Numbers** sequence starting at 3 ($3, 4, 5, 6, \dots$). The number of corners (vertices) follows the exact same sequence.

  <svg width="400" height="120" viewBox="0 0 400 120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2">
    {/* Triangle */}
    <polygon points="50,20 20,80 80,80" />
    <text x="50" y="105" stroke="none" fill="currentColor" text-anchor="middle" font-size="12">Triangle (3)</text>

    {/* Square */}
    <rect x="130" y="30" width="50" height="50" />
    <text x="155" y="105" stroke="none" fill="currentColor" text-anchor="middle" font-size="12">Square (4)</text>

    {/* Pentagon */}
    <polygon points="250,20 220,45 230,80 270,80 280,45" />
    <text x="250" y="105" stroke="none" fill="currentColor" text-anchor="middle" font-size="12">Pentagon (5)</text>
  </svg>
</div>

### 2. Complete Graphs
A **Complete Graph** is a shape where every corner is connected to every other corner by a line.
*   **K2 (2 points):** 1 line.
*   **K3 (3 points):** 3 lines (Triangle).
*   **K4 (4 points):** 6 lines (Square with X inside).
*   **K5 (5 points):** 10 lines (Pentagon with star inside).

The sequence of the *number of lines* in Complete Graphs is: **1, 3, 6, 10, 15...**

**Pattern Alert:** This is the **Triangular Number** sequence!
</Callout>

### 3. Koch Snowflake
The Koch Snowflake is a fractal pattern. You start with a triangle and repeatedly add smaller triangles to the middle of every side.
*   The boundary gets more complex with each step.
*   The number of line segments grows rapidly: **3, 12, 48, 192...**
*   This sequence is $3 \times$ **Powers of 4**.
