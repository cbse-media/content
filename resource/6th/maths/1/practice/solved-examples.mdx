## Example 1: The "Handshake" Problem (Complete Graphs)

**Question:** If 5 people meet in a room and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes happen?

**Solution:**
This is identical to the "Complete Graph" problem with 5 points ($K_5$).
1.  Person A shakes hands with 4 others.
2.  Person B shakes hands with 3 others (excluding A, already done).
3.  Person C shakes hands with 2 others.
4.  Person D shakes hands with 1 other.
5.  Person E has no new people to shake hands with.

Total = $4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10$.
This is the 4th **Triangular Number**.

## Example 2: Hexagonal Numbers Logic

**Question:** What is the rule for forming Hexagonal Numbers: 1, 7, 19, 37...?

**Solution:**
Let's look at the difference between consecutive terms:
*   $7 - 1 = 6$
*   $19 - 7 = 12$
*   $37 - 19 = 18$

The differences are multiples of 6 ($6 \times 1, 6 \times 2, 6 \times 3$).
To find the next number:
1.  Next difference will be $6 \times 4 = 24$.
2.  Add this to the last number: $37 + 24 = 61$.

## Example 3: Powers of 2

**Question:** Why does adding the sequence of Powers of 2 (starting from 1) almost give the next power of 2?

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 &= 1 & (\text{which is } 2^1 - 1) \\
1 + 2 &= 3 & (\text{which is } 2^2 - 1) \\
1 + 2 + 4 &= 7 & (\text{which is } 2^3 - 1) \\
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 &= 15 & (\text{which is } 2^4 - 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

**Concept:** The sum of powers of 2 up to $2^n$ is always one less than the next power ($2^{n+1} - 1$).
