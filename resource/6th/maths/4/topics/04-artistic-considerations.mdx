## Vertical vs. Horizontal Bars

Does it matter if the bars go up or sideways?
While the data remains the same, the presentation can make it more intuitive.

*   **Vertical Bars (Column Graphs):** Best for heights or amounts measured upwards from the ground (e.g., height of mountains, number of students).
*   **Horizontal Bars:** Best for lengths parallel to the ground or distances (e.g., length of rivers, running distances).

### Example: Tallest Mountains

Since mountains grow upwards, a vertical bar graph is visually suggestive of the subject matter.

### Example: Longest Rivers

Rivers flow across the land. A horizontal bar graph mimics the flow of a river better than a vertical column.

## Infographics

When graphs are beautified with artistic imagery, they are called **Infographics**.
Instead of plain rectangular bars, an artist might use:
*   Triangles to represent mountains.
*   Pencils to represent school supplies.

<Callout variant="warning">
**Caution:** Fancy graphics can sometimes be misleading! If you use a triangle to represent a mountain, a taller triangle is also *wider* at the base. This might make the data look much larger than it actually is. Always check the scale and the axis values, not just the size of the picture.
