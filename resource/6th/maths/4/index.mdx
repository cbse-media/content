## Introduction

We live in an age of information. If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, or measure the weight of each student, you are collecting **Data**.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Definition:** Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations, or other descriptions of things that convey information about those things is called **data**.
</Callout>

In this chapter, we will explore how to collect data, organize it efficiently using tally marks, and present it visually using pictographs and bar graphs to make interpretations and inferences.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers the following key topics:

1.  **Collecting and Organising Data**: How to record data systematically using tables and tally marks.
2.  **Pictographs**: Representing data using symbols and pictures.
3.  **Bar Graphs**: Using bars of uniform width to represent data frequencies.
4.  **Artistic Considerations**: How the orientation and design of graphs can affect readability.

## Key Formulas & Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data** | A collection of facts, numbers, or observations. |
| **Frequency** | The number of times a particular entry or value occurs. |
| **Tally Marks** | A method of counting frequencies using groups of 5 strokes (4 vertical, 1 diagonal). |
| **Scale** | The value represented by one unit length on a bar graph or one symbol in a pictograph (e.g., 1 unit = 10 students). |
| **Bar Graph** | A visual representation of data using bars of uniform width and varying heights. |
| **Pictograph** | A visual representation of data using pictures or symbols. |

Let's begin by learning how to collect and organize raw data.
