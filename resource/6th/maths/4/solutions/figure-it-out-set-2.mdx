## Page 83: Figure it Out (Library Books)

**Q1. The pictograph shows books borrowed.**
Scale: 1 Book Symbol = 1 Book (implied from context or standard unit if not explicit, but solution implies simple counting).

*   **Monday:** 5 symbols
*   **Tuesday:** 4 symbols
*   **Wednesday:** 2 symbols
*   **Thursday:** 0 symbols (Empty)
*   **Friday:** 5 symbols
*   **Saturday:** 8 symbols

**Answers:**
*   a. **Thursday** (0 books, minimum).
*   b. Total books = $5 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 5 + 8 = 24$.
*   c. **Saturday** (Maximum). Possible reason: It's the weekend, so students borrow books to read over the holiday/Sunday.

**Q2. Magan Bhai's Kites (Page 84)**
Data:
*   Chaman: 250
*   Rani: 300
*   Rukhsana: 100
*   Jasmeet: 450
*   Jetha Lal: 250
*   Poonam Ben: 700

**Pictograph Task:** Scale $\diamond = 100$ kites.

*   **Chaman:** 2 full symbols, 1 half symbol ($200 + 50$).
*   **Rani:** 3 full symbols.
*   **Rukhsana:** 1 full symbol.
*   **Jasmeet:** 4 full symbols, 1 half symbol.
*   **Jetha Lal:** 2 full symbols, 1 half symbol.
*   **Poonam Ben:** 7 full symbols.

**Answers to Questions:**
*   a. How many symbols represent Rani's kites? **3 symbols**.
*   b. Who purchased the maximum number? **Poonam Ben** (700).
*   c. Who purchased more, Jasmeet (450) or Chaman (250)? **Jasmeet**.
*   d. Is Poonam Ben's purchase (700) more than double Rani's (300)?
    *   Rani $\times 2 = 600$.
    *   Poonam = 700.
    *   $700 > 600$. **Yes, she is correct.**
