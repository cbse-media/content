## Page 86: Figure it Out (Class Attendance)

Refer to the bar graph on page 86 of the text.
*   Class 1: 3 absent
*   Class 2: 5 absent
*   Class 3: 4 absent
*   Class 4: 2 absent
*   Class 5: 0 absent
*   Class 6: 1 absent
*   Class 7: 5 absent
*   Class 8: 7 absent

**Answers:**
1.  In Class 2, **5** students were absent.
2.  In which class were the maximum number of students absent? **Class 8**.
3.  Which class had full attendance (0 absent)? **Class 5**.

## Page 88: Figure it Out (Traffic Crossing)

**Q1. How many total cars passed through the crossing between 6 a.m. and noon?**
Using the graph:
*   6-7 am: 150
*   7-8 am: 1200
*   8-9 am: 1000
*   9-10 am: 900
*   10-11 am: 600 (Estimated from graph description)
*   11-12 pm: 600 (Text says "about 600" for 11-12).
*   *Note: The text explicitly calculates 8-10am as 1800. Summing all bars:*
    $150 + 1200 + 1000 + 900 + 600 + 600 = 4450$.
    **Ans: 4450 cars.**

**Q2. Why little traffic 6-7 am?**
**Ans:** Most offices and schools start later (around 8 or 9 am), so fewer people are commuting that early.

**Q3. Why heaviest traffic 7-8 am?**
**Ans:** This is the peak rush hour when school buses and office goers are travelling.

**Q4. Why lesser traffic after 8 am?**
**Ans:** Once the school/office start times pass, the rush decreases.
