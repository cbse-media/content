## Page 75: Figure it Out

**Q1. What would you do to find the most popular game among Naresh’s and Navya’s classmates?**
**Ans:** One of the effective ways is to arrange and organize the collected data into a table or frequency distribution table to clearly see the counts.

**Q2. What is the most popular game in their class?**
**Ans:** Hockey. From the list provided in the text, Hockey appears 8 times (Frequency = 8).

**Q4. Pari wants to respond to questions. Put a tick (✓) where she needs to collect data.**
*   a. What is the most popular TV show among her classmates? **(✓)** (Need to ask classmates)
*   b. When did India get independence? **(✕)** (Fact, no collection needed)
*   c. How much water is getting wasted in her locality? **(✓)** (Observation required)
*   d. What is the capital of India? **(✕)** (Fact)

**Q1. Complete the table to help Shri Nilesh purchase sweets.**

Using the tally marks provided in the chapter:
*   **Jalebi:** `||||` `|` = 6
*   **Gulab Jamun:** `||||` `||||` = 9
*   **Gujiya:** `||||` `||||` `|||` = 13
*   **Barfi:** `|||` = 3
*   **Rasgulla:** `||||` `||` = 7

**Answers:**
*   a. How many students chose jalebi? **6**
*   b. Barfi was chosen by **3** students.
*   c. How many students chose gujiya? **13**
*   d. Rasgulla was chosen by **7** students.
*   e. How many students chose gulab jamun? **9**

**Q2. Is the above table sufficient to distribute each type of sweet to the correct student?**
**Ans:** **No.** The table only gives the *total number* (frequency) of each sweet needed. It does not tell us *which specific student* asked for which sweet. Shri Nilesh knows he needs 6 Jalebis, but he doesn't know who to give them to.
**Alternative:** Maintain a list with Student Name corresponding to their Choice.

## Page 77: Figure it Out (Shoe Sizes)

**Q1. Help her to figure out the following:**
The ordered data is: 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7.

*   a. The largest shoe size in the class is **7**.
*   b. The smallest shoe size in the class is **3**.
*   c. There are **10** students who wear shoe size 5. (Count the 5s).
*   d. There are **15** students who wear shoe sizes larger than 4. (Count sizes 5, 6, and 7: $10 + 4 + 1 = 15$).

**Q2. How did arranging the data in ascending order help?**
**Ans:** It grouped identical values together, making it much faster to count frequencies and identify the minimum and maximum values without searching through a jumbled list.
