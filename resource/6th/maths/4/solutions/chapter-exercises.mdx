### Faiz's Cricket Statistics (Page 95)

**Q5a. What information is this table giving?**
It shows the number of wickets taken by Jaspreet Bumrah in his last 30 matches.

**Q5d. In how many matches has Bumrah taken 4 wickets?**
Looking at the row for "4 wickets": **3 matches**.

**Q5e. Can Mayank get the total wickets by adding 0+1+2...+7?**
**No.** That just adds the *categories* of wickets (0 to 7). To find the total wickets taken, you must multiply the number of wickets by the number of matches (Frequency) and then sum them up.

**Q5f. Correct Calculation:**
Total Wickets = $(0 \times 2) + (1 \times 4) + (2 \times 6) + (3 \times 8) + (4 \times 3) + (5 \times 5) + (6 \times 1) + (7 \times 1)$
$= 0 + 4 + 12 + 24 + 12 + 25 + 6 + 7 = 90$ wickets.

*   Class 1: 6 faces = 24 girls.
*   Class 2: 4.5 faces = $4 \times 4 + 2 = 18$ girls.
*   Class 3: 5 faces = 20 girls.
*   Class 4: 3.5 faces = $3 \times 4 + 2 = 14$ girls.
*   Class 5: 2.5 faces = $2 \times 4 + 2 = 10$ girls.
*   Class 6: 4 faces = 16 girls.
*   Class 7: 3 faces = 12 girls.
*   Class 8: 1.5 faces = 6 girls.
