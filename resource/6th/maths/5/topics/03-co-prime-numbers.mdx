## What are Co-prime Numbers?

Two numbers are said to be **co-prime** if they have **no common factor other than 1**.

**Example: 4 and 9**
*   Factors of 4: 1, 2, 4
*   Factors of 9: 1, 3, 9
*   Common Factors: Only **1**.
*   Conclusion: **4 and 9 are co-prime.**

**Example: 15 and 39**
*   Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15
*   Factors of 39: 1, 3, 13, 39
*   Common Factors: 1, **3**.
*   Conclusion: **Not co-prime** (because they share 3).

<Callout variant="tip">
**Key Note:** The numbers themselves do NOT have to be prime to be co-prime. 4 and 9 are both composite, yet they are co-prime to each other.

### Co-prime Art (Thread Art)

If you arrange pegs in a circle and connect them with a thread using a specific gap:
*   If the total number of pegs and the gap size are **co-prime**, the thread will touch **every peg**.
*   If they share a common factor, the thread will form a smaller loop and miss some pegs.

**Visualizing Thread Art (12 pegs, gap 4):**
12 and 4 share a factor (4). The thread hits 12, 4, 8, then back to 12. It misses most pegs.

**Visualizing Thread Art (13 pegs, gap 3):**
13 is prime, so 13 and 3 are co-prime. The thread will eventually touch every single peg.

## Properties of Co-primes in Multiplication

When playing the *Idli-Vada* game with co-prime numbers (like 3 and 5):
*   The first **Common Multiple** is exactly the **Product** of the two numbers ($3 \times 5 = 15$).

If numbers are NOT co-prime (like 4 and 6, common factor 2):
*   The first Common Multiple (12) is **less than** their product ($4 \times 6 = 24$).
