### Q. Primes and Composites from 21 to 30.
Numbers: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
*   **Primes:** 23, 29 (Count: 2).
*   **Composites:** 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30 (Count: 8).

### Q1. Is there any other even prime besides 2?
**Answer:** No.
**Reason:** Any other even number is divisible by 2 (has factors 1, 2, itself...), making it composite.

### Q2. Smallest and largest difference between successive primes (1-100).
*   **Smallest:** 3 - 2 = **1**. (This is the only pair with diff 1).
*   **Largest:** Look at gaps.
    *   89 to 97. Difference = **8**.

### Q4. Which are prime: 23, 51, 37, 26?
*   23: Prime.
*   51: Composite ($3 \times 17$).
*   37: Prime.
*   26: Composite ($2 \times 13$).
**Answer:** 23 and 37.

### Q6. Pairs like 13 and 31 (Prime with same digits).
**Answer:**
*   17 and 71
*   37 and 73
*   79 and 97

### Q7. Seven consecutive composite numbers (1-100).
We need a large gap between primes.
Look at the 90s:
90, 91 ($7 \times 13$), 92, 93 ($3 \times 31$), 94, 95, 96.
Next prime is 97.
**Answer:** 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96.

### Q8. Twin Primes (Diff 2).
**Answer:**
(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73).
