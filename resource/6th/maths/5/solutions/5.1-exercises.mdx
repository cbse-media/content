### Q1. At what number is ‘idli-vada’ said for the 10th time?
**Solution:**
'Idli-vada' is said at common multiples of 3 and 5.
LCM of 3 and 5 is 15.
The sequence is: 15, 30, 45, 60...
The 10th time will be $15 \times 10 = \mathbf{150}$.

### Q2. Game played from 1 to 90.
**a. How many times 'idli'?**
Multiples of 3 in 90: $90 \div 3 = 30$.
**Answer:** 30 times.

**b. How many times 'vada'?**
Multiples of 5 in 90: $90 \div 5 = 18$.
**Answer:** 18 times.

**c. How many times 'idli-vada'?**
Multiples of 15 in 90: $90 \div 15 = 6$.
(15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90).
**Answer:** 6 times.

### Q3. Game played till 900?
*   'Idli' (Multiples of 3): $900 \div 3 = 300$ times.
*   'Vada' (Multiples of 5): $900 \div 5 = 180$ times.
*   'Idli-Vada' (Multiples of 15): $900 \div 15 = 60$ times.

### Q1. Multiples of 40 between 310 and 410.
Multiples of 40: 40, 80... 280, 320, 360, 400, 440.
Numbers between 310 and 410 are:
**Answer:** 320, 360, 400.

### Q2. Who am I?
**a. Less than 40. Factor is 7. Sum of digits is 8.**
Multiples of 7 less than 40: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35.
Sums of digits:
*   7 (7)
*   14 (1+4=5)
*   21 (2+1=3)
*   28 (2+8=10)
*   35 (3+5=8) -> Match!
**Answer:** 35.

**b. Less than 100. Factors 3 and 5. Digits differ by 1.**
Multiples of 3 and 5 (i.e., 15): 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90.
Digit Check:
*   15: Diff = 4
*   30: Diff = 3
*   45: Diff = 1 ($5-4=1$) -> Match!
*   60: Diff = 6
*   75: Diff = 2
*   90: Diff = 9
**Answer:** 45.

### Q7. Treasure Hunt (Page 111)
Treasures on 28 and 70. Find jump sizes (Common Factors).
*   Factors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
*   Factors of 70: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70.
*   Common Factors: 1, 2, 7, 14.
**Answer:** Jump sizes 1, 2, 7, or 14.

### Q9. Smallest multiple of 1 to 10 except 7.
We need the LCM of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10.
*   LCM(8, 9, 5) covers most. $8 \times 9 \times 5 = 360$.
*   Check divisibility:
    *   360 div by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10? Yes.
**Answer:** 360.

### Q10. Smallest multiple of 1 to 10.
We need LCM of 1 to 10 (including 7).
From Q9, we have 360 (which contains factors for everything except 7).
Since 7 is prime, multiply 360 by 7.
$360 \times 7 = 2520$.
**Answer:** 2520.
