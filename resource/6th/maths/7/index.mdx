## Introduction

Recall that when a whole number of things are shared equally among some number of people, **fractions** tell us how much each share is.

If one *roti* (flatbread) is divided equally between two children, each child gets half a *roti*.
The fraction 'one half' is written as $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Key Concept:**
A fraction represents a part of a whole. In the fraction $\frac{5}{6}$:
*   **5** is the **Numerator** (number of parts we have).
*   **6** is the **Denominator** (total number of equal parts the whole is divided into).

### A Pinch of History
In ancient India, a fraction was called **bhinna** (Sanskrit for 'broken'). It was also called *bhaga* or *ansha* meaning 'part'.
The way we write fractions today ($\frac{1}{2}$) originated in India. It appears in the **Bakhshali manuscript** (c. 300 CE) and was used by mathematicians like **Aryabhata** and **Brahmagupta**.

### Formula Sheet

$$
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}}
$$

**Brahmagupta’s Method for Addition/Subtraction:**
1.  Find a common denominator.
2.  Convert fractions to equivalent fractions.
3.  Add or subtract the numerators.
4.  Simplify if needed.

$$
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}
$$
