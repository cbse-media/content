## Fractional Units

When one unit is divided into several equal parts, each part is called a **fractional unit** (or unit fraction).
Examples: $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{100}$.

### Comparing Unit Fractions
A common mistake is thinking that $\frac{1}{9}$ is bigger than $\frac{1}{5}$ because 9 is bigger than 5. **This is incorrect.**

Think of sharing a *roti*:
*   If you share 1 roti among **5 people**, you get a slice size of $\frac{1}{5}$.
*   If you share 1 roti among **9 people**, you get a slice size of $\frac{1}{9}$.

Sharing with *more* people means each person gets *less*. Therefore:
$$
\frac{1}{9} < \frac{1}{5}
$$

## Parts of a Whole

We can measure larger pieces using fractional units.
If a whole *chikki* (a sweet bar) is broken into 4 equal pieces, the fractional unit is $\frac{1}{4}$.

If we take 3 of those pieces, we have:
$$
3 \text{ times } \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ chikki}
$$

We usually read $\frac{3}{4}$ as "three quarters" or "three upon four". Reading it as "3 times $\frac{1}{4}$" helps us understand that it consists of 3 units of size $\frac{1}{4}$.
