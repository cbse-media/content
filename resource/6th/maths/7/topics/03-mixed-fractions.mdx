## Fractions Greater than One

If the numerator is **smaller** than the denominator (e.g., $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}$), the fraction is less than 1.
If the numerator is **larger** than the denominator (e.g., $\frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{4}$), the fraction is greater than 1.

Example: $\frac{3}{2}$ means 3 halves.
$$
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}
$$

## Mixed Numbers

A **mixed number** (or mixed fraction) contains a whole number part and a fractional part.
Instead of writing $\frac{9}{2}$, we can see how many whole units fit.
$\frac{9}{2}$ is 9 halves. Since 2 halves make a whole, 8 halves make 4 wholes. We have 1 half left.
$$
\frac{9}{2} = 4 \frac{1}{2}
$$

This is read as "four and a half".

### Converting Mixed Numbers to Fractions
To write $3 \frac{3}{4}$ as a regular fraction:
1.  Multiply the whole number by the denominator: $3 \times 4 = 12$.
2.  Add the numerator: $12 + 3 = 15$.
3.  Keep the denominator: $\frac{15}{4}$.

$$
3 \frac{3}{4} = \frac{(3 \times 4) + 3}{4} = \frac{15}{4}
$$
