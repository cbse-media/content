## Visualizing Equivalent Fractions

Look at a fraction wall.
*   One strip divided into 2 parts ($\frac{1}{2}$).
*   One strip divided into 4 parts ($\frac{1}{4}$).

You will see that one piece of $\frac{1}{2}$ is the exact same length as two pieces of $\frac{1}{4}$.
$$
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{4}{8}
$$

These are **equivalent fractions**. They denote the same length but use different fractional units.

## Creating Equivalent Fractions
To find an equivalent fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by the **same number**.

$$
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 2}{4 \times 2} = \frac{6}{8}
$$
$$
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 10}{4 \times 10} = \frac{30}{40}
$$

## Lowest Terms (Simplest Form)
A fraction is in its **lowest terms** if the numerator and denominator have no common factor except 1.
To simplify a fraction, divide the numerator and denominator by their highest common factor.

**Example:** Reduce $\frac{16}{20}$.
Common factor is 4.
$$
\frac{16 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{4}{5}
$$
$\frac{4}{5}$ is the simplest form.
