## Brahmagupta's Method

Brahmagupta (628 CE) formally described the rules we use today.

### Step 1: Common Fractional Unit
If denominators are different, find a common denominator (often the product of the two denominators).
Example: Add $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$.
Common denominator = $4 \times 3 = 12$.

$$
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}
$$

### Step 2: Add/Subtract Numerators
Now that the units are the same ($\frac{1}{12}$), we just add the number of pieces.
$$
\frac{3}{12} + \frac{4}{12} = \frac{3+4}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
$$

### Subtraction Example
Subtract $\frac{2}{3}$ from $\frac{3}{4}$.
Problem: $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{2}{3}$.
Common Denominator: 12.

$$
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12}
$$
$$
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{12}
$$

$$
\frac{9}{12} - \frac{8}{12} = \frac{1}{12}
$$
