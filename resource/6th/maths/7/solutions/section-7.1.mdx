## Page 152: Figure It Out

**Q1. Three guavas together weigh 1 kg. If they are roughly of the same size, each guava will roughly weigh ____ kg.**
**Answer:** $\frac{1}{3}$ kg.
*Reasoning:* 1 whole unit divided by 3 items.

**Q2. A wholesale merchant packed 1 kg of rice in four packets of equal weight. The weight of each packet is ___ kg.**
**Answer:** $\frac{1}{4}$ kg.

**Q3. Four friends ordered 3 glasses of sugarcane juice and shared it equally among themselves. Each one drank ____ glass of sugarcane juice.**

**Q4. The big fish weighs $\frac{1}{2}$ kg. The small one weighs $\frac{1}{4}$ kg. Together they weigh ____ kg.**
**Answer:** $\frac{3}{4}$ kg.
*Reasoning:* $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}$. So $\frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$.

**Q5. Arrange these fraction words in order of size from the smallest to the biggest:**

**Answer:**
1.  Quarter ($\frac{1}{4}$)
2.  Half ($\frac{1}{2}$)
3.  Three quarters ($\frac{3}{4}$)
4.  One and a quarter ($1 \frac{1}{4}$)
5.  One and a half ($1 \frac{1}{2}$)
6.  Two and a half ($2 \frac{1}{2}$)
