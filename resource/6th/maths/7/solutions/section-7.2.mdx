## Page 154
**Q. By dividing the whole chikki into 6 equal parts in different ways, we get $\frac{1}{6}$ chikki pieces of different shapes. Are they of the same size?**
**Answer:** Yes.
*Reasoning:* Even though the shapes are different, they represent the same amount (area) of the whole because the whole was divided into 6 *equal* parts.
