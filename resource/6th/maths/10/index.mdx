# The Other Side of Zero

Welcome to the world of Integers! Until now, we have mostly dealt with counting numbers ($1, 2, 3...$) and zero. But what happens when you go below zero? This chapter introduces **negative numbers**, used to describe temperatures below freezing, floors below ground, or debts in a bank account.

## Key Concepts

<Callout variant="tip">
**Integers:** The collection of numbers comprising whole numbers $(0, 1, 2, 3...)$ and their negatives $(-1, -2, -3...)$.
</Callout>

*   **Positive Numbers:** Numbers greater than $0$ (e.g., $+1, +5, +100$).
*   **Negative Numbers:** Numbers less than $0$ (e.g., $-1, -5, -100$).
*   **Zero:** The reference point. It is neither positive nor negative.

## Formula & Rules Sheet

### 1. Opposites & Inverses
Every number has an **additive inverse**. When added together, they equal zero.
$$
a + (-a) = 0
$$
*Example:* $+3 + (-3) = 0$

### 2. Addition (Movement Rule)
Think of addition as movement on a number line:
*   Adding a **positive** number $\rightarrow$ Move **Right** (or Up).
*   Adding a **negative** number $\rightarrow$ Move **Left** (or Down).
$$
\text{Starting Position} + \text{Movement} = \text{Target Position}
$$

### 3. Subtraction (Difference Rule)
Subtraction can be thought of as finding the distance or movement needed to get from one number to another.
$$
\text{Target} - \text{Start} = \text{Movement Needed}
$$
Alternatively, subtracting a number is the same as **adding its inverse**:
$$
a - b = a + (-b)
$$
*Example:* $5 - 2 = 5 + (-2) = 3$
