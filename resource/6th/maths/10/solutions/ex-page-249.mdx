## Complete these expressions
Think: $\text{Target} - \text{Start} = \text{Movement}$

*   **a. $(+1) - (+4) = -3$** (To go from 4 to 1, move down 3)
*   **b. $(0) - (+2) = -2$** (From 2 to 0, move down 2)
*   **c. $(+4) - (+1) = +3$** (From 1 to 4, move up 3)
*   **d. $(0) - (-2) = +2$** (From -2 to 0, move up 2)
*   **e. $(+4) - (-3) = +7$** (From -3 to 4, move up 7)
*   **f. $(-4) - (-3) = -1$** (From -3 to -4, move down 1)
*   **g. $(-1) - (+2) = -3$** (From 2 to -1, move down 3)
*   **h. $(-2) - (-2) = 0$** (No movement)
*   **i. $(-1) - (+1) = -2$** (From 1 to -1, move down 2)
*   **j. $(+3) - (-3) = +6$** (From -3 to 3, move up 6)
