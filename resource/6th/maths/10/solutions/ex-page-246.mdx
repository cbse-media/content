## Figure it Out - Combining Presses

Evaluate these expressions:
*   **a. (+1) + (+4) =** $+5$
*   **b. (+4) + (+1) =** $+5$
*   **c. (+4) + (-3) + (-2) =**
    *   $4 - 3 = 1$
    *   $1 - 2 = -1$
    *   **Answer:** $-1$
*   **d. (-1) + (+2) + (-3) =**
    *   $-1 + 2 = +1$
    *   $+1 - 3 = -2$
    *   **Answer:** $-2$

## Inverses

**Write the inverses of these numbers:**
*   Inverse of **+4** is **-4**.
*   Inverse of **-4** is **+4**.
*   Inverse of **-3** is **+3**.
*   Inverse of **0** is **0**.
*   Inverse of **+2** is **-2**.
*   Inverse of **-1** is **+1**.

**Comparing Numbers using Floors:**
*   **Jay (Art Centre):** Floor +2.
*   **Asin (Sports Centre):** Floor +5.
*   **Binnu (Cinema):** Floor -3.
*   **Aman (Toys):** Floor -1.

**Who is on the lowest floor?**
Binnu is on Floor -3, which is the lowest number (deepest underground).
