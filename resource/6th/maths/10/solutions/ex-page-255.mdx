## Use Unmarked Number Lines

**a. -125 + (-30) = \_\_\_\_**
*   Start at -125.
*   Move further left (negative direction) by 30.
*   Result: **-155**

**b. +105 - (-55) = \_\_\_\_**
*   Subtracting a negative is adding a positive.
*   $105 + 55 = 160$.
*   Result: **+160**

**c. +80 - (-150) = \_\_\_\_**
*   $80 + 150 = 230$.
*   Result: **+230**

**d. -99 - (-200) = \_\_\_\_**
*   Start at -99.
*   Subtracting -200 means adding 200 (Move Right).
*   From -99 to 0 is 99 steps. We have $200 - 99 = 101$ steps left to go right.
*   Result: **+101**
