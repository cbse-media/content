## Real World Integers

### 1. Temperature
We measure temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
*   **0°C:** Freezing point of water.
*   **Positive:** Hotter days (e.g., 30°C in Summer).
*   **Negative:** Very cold places (e.g., -10°C in Ladakh).

### 2. Banking (Debits and Credits)
*   **Credit (+):** Money deposited or added to your account.
*   **Debit (-):** Money spent or taken out.
*   If you have ₹100 and spend ₹150, your balance is $100 - 150 = -50$. You owe the bank ₹50.

### 3. Elevation
*   **Sea Level:** 0 meters.
*   **Mount Everest:** +8848m (Above sea level).
*   **Mariana Trench:** -10,994m (Below sea level).

## A Pinch of History

Integers, including zero and negative numbers, have deep roots in India.
*   **Brahmagupta (628 CE):** An Indian mathematician who wrote the *Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta*. He gave rules for computing with zero and negative numbers long before they were accepted in Europe.

### Brahmagupta's Rules (Simplified)
1.  **Addition:**
    *   Sum of two positives is positive.
    *   Sum of two negatives is negative.
    *   Sum of a positive and negative is the difference between them.
2.  **Zero:**
    *   A number plus its inverse is Zero.
    *   Subtracting a number from itself is Zero.
