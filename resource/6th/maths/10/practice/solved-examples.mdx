## Example 1: The Mine Shaft

**Problem:** A lift in a mine moves at a speed of 5 meters per minute. It starts from 10 meters above the ground.
1.  Where will it be after 1 hour if it moves down?
2.  How long will it take to reach -350 meters?

### Solution

**Part 1: Position after 1 hour**
*   **Start Position:** $+10$ m.
*   **Speed:** $5$ m/min downwards ($-5$).
*   **Time:** $1$ hour = $60$ minutes.
*   **Total Movement:** $60 \times (-5) = -300$ m.
*   **Final Position:** $\text{Start} + \text{Movement} = 10 + (-300) = -290$ m.
*   **Answer:** 290 meters below ground.

**Part 2: Time to reach -350m**
*   **Target:** $-350$.
*   **Start:** $+10$.
*   **Distance to travel:** $\text{Target} - \text{Start} = -350 - 10 = -360$ m.
*   The lift must travel 360 meters down.
*   **Speed:** 5m/min.
*   **Time:** $360 \div 5 = 72$ minutes.
*   **Answer:** 1 hour and 12 minutes.

## Example 2: Magic Square

In a magic square, each row, column, and diagonal sums to the same number. Check if this is a magic square:

| 5 | -1 | -4 |
|---|----|----|
| -5| -2 | 7 |
| 0 | 3 | -3 |

**Check Rows:**
1.  $5 + (-1) + (-4) = 0$
2.  $-5 + (-2) + 7 = 0$
3.  $0 + 3 + (-3) = 0$

**Check Columns:**
1.  $5 + (-5) + 0 = 0$
2.  $-1 + (-2) + 3 = 0$
3.  $-4 + 7 + (-3) = 0$

**Check Diagonals:**
1.  $5 + (-2) + (-3) = 0$
2.  $-4 + (-2) + 0 = -6$ (Wait! This is not 0).

**Conclusion:** Since one diagonal sums to -6, this is **NOT** a magic square.
