## Introduction

Recall that when a whole number of things are shared equally among some number of people, **fractions** tell us how much each share is.

If one *roti* (flatbread) is divided equally between two children, each child gets half a *roti*.
The fraction 'one half' is written as $\frac{1}{2}$.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Key Concept:**
A fraction represents a part of a whole. In the fraction $\frac{5}{6}$:
*   **5** is the **Numerator** (number of parts we have).
*   **6** is the **Denominator** (total number of equal parts the whole is divided into).
</Callout>

### A Pinch of History
In ancient India, a fraction was called **bhinna** (Sanskrit for 'broken'). It was also called *bhaga* or *ansha* meaning 'part'.
The way we write fractions today ($\frac{1}{2}$) originated in India. It appears in the **Bakhshali manuscript** (c. 300 CE) and was used by mathematicians like **Aryabhata** and **Brahmagupta**.

## Fractional Units

When one unit is divided into several equal parts, each part is called a **fractional unit** (or unit fraction).
Examples: $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{100}$.

### Comparing Unit Fractions
A common mistake is thinking that $\frac{1}{9}$ is bigger than $\frac{1}{5}$ because 9 is bigger than 5. **This is incorrect.**

Think of sharing a *roti*:
*   If you share 1 roti among **5 people**, you get a slice size of $\frac{1}{5}$.
*   If you share 1 roti among **9 people**, you get a slice size of $\frac{1}{9}$.

Sharing with *more* people means each person gets *less*. Therefore:
$$
\frac{1}{9} < \frac{1}{5}
$$

## Parts of a Whole

We can measure larger pieces using fractional units.
If a whole *chikki* (a sweet bar) is broken into 4 equal pieces, the fractional unit is $\frac{1}{4}$.

If we take 3 of those pieces, we have:
$$
3 \text{ times } \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ chikki}
$$

We usually read $\frac{3}{4}$ as "three quarters" or "three upon four". Reading it as "3 times $\frac{1}{4}$" helps us understand that it consists of 3 units of size $\frac{1}{4}$.

## Measuring with Paper Strips

Imagine a strip of paper representing **1 unit**.
1.  Fold it in half $\rightarrow$ Each part is $\frac{1}{2}$.
2.  Fold it in half again $\rightarrow$ You now have 4 equal parts. Each is $\frac{1}{4}$.
3.  Fold it again $\rightarrow$ You have 8 equal parts. Each is $\frac{1}{8}$.

We can collect these units:
*   2 times $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4}$
*   3 times $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$
*   4 times $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$ (The whole strip)

## Fractions on the Number Line

We place integers ($0, 1, 2, \dots$) on the number line. We can also place fractions between them.
The distance between 0 and 1 is one unit.

If we divide this distance into 2 equal parts, the midpoint is $\frac{1}{2}$.
If we divide it into 3 equal parts, the marks are at $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$.

## Fractions Greater than One

If the numerator is **smaller** than the denominator (e.g., $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}$), the fraction is less than 1.
If the numerator is **larger** than the denominator (e.g., $\frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{4}$), the fraction is greater than 1.

Example: $\frac{3}{2}$ means 3 halves.
$$
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}
$$

## Mixed Numbers

A **mixed number** (or mixed fraction) contains a whole number part and a fractional part.
Instead of writing $\frac{9}{2}$, we can see how many whole units fit.
$\frac{9}{2}$ is 9 halves. Since 2 halves make a whole, 8 halves make 4 wholes. We have 1 half left.
$$
\frac{9}{2} = 4 \frac{1}{2}
$$

This is read as "four and a half".

### Converting Mixed Numbers to Fractions
To write $3 \frac{3}{4}$ as a regular fraction:
1.  Multiply the whole number by the denominator: $3 \times 4 = 12$.
2.  Add the numerator: $12 + 3 = 15$.
3.  Keep the denominator: $\frac{15}{4}$.

$$
3 \frac{3}{4} = \frac{(3 \times 4) + 3}{4} = \frac{15}{4}
$$

## Visualizing Equivalent Fractions

Look at a fraction wall.
*   One strip divided into 2 parts ($\frac{1}{2}$).
*   One strip divided into 4 parts ($\frac{1}{4}$).

You will see that one piece of $\frac{1}{2}$ is the exact same length as two pieces of $\frac{1}{4}$.
$$
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{4}{8}
$$

These are **equivalent fractions**. They denote the same length but use different fractional units.

## Creating Equivalent Fractions
To find an equivalent fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by the **same number**.

$$
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 2}{4 \times 2} = \frac{6}{8}
$$
$$
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 10}{4 \times 10} = \frac{30}{40}
$$

## Lowest Terms (Simplest Form)
A fraction is in its **lowest terms** if the numerator and denominator have no common factor except 1.
To simplify a fraction, divide the numerator and denominator by their highest common factor.

**Example:** Reduce $\frac{16}{20}$.
Common factor is 4.
$$
\frac{16 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{4}{5}
$$
$\frac{4}{5}$ is the simplest form.

## Case 1: Same Denominator
If the denominators (fractional units) are the same, just compare the numerators.
$$
\frac{4}{7} \text{ vs } \frac{6}{7}
$$
Since $6 > 4$, clearly $\frac{6}{7} > \frac{4}{7}$.

## Case 2: Same Numerator
If the numerators are the same (same number of pieces), compare the denominators. Remember: Larger denominator = Smaller pieces.
$$
\frac{3}{4} \text{ vs } \frac{3}{7}
$$
Shares of $\frac{1}{4}$ are bigger than shares of $\frac{1}{7}$. So $\frac{3}{4} > \frac{3}{7}$.

## Case 3: Different Numerators and Denominators
To compare $\frac{4}{5}$ and $\frac{7}{9}$, we must make their units (denominators) the same.

1.  Find a common multiple for 5 and 9. $5 \times 9 = 45$.
2.  Convert both fractions to have denominator 45.

$$
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{4 \times 9}{5 \times 9} = \frac{36}{45}
$$
$$
\frac{7}{9} = \frac{7 \times 5}{9 \times 5} = \frac{35}{45}
$$

3.  Compare: $\frac{36}{45} > \frac{35}{45}$.
    Therefore, $\frac{4}{5} > \frac{7}{9}$.

## Brahmagupta's Method

Brahmagupta (628 CE) formally described the rules we use today.

### Step 1: Common Fractional Unit
If denominators are different, find a common denominator (often the product of the two denominators).
Example: Add $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$.
Common denominator = $4 \times 3 = 12$.

$$
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}
$$

### Step 2: Add/Subtract Numerators
Now that the units are the same ($\frac{1}{12}$), we just add the number of pieces.
$$
\frac{3}{12} + \frac{4}{12} = \frac{3+4}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
$$

### Subtraction Example
Subtract $\frac{2}{3}$ from $\frac{3}{4}$.
Problem: $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{2}{3}$.
Common Denominator: 12.

$$
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12}
$$
$$
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{12}
$$

$$
\frac{9}{12} - \frac{8}{12} = \frac{1}{12}
$$

*   **b.** $\frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12}$ (Wait, $4 \times 4 = 16$. The text says "12 kgs... in \_\_ bags". Ah, potatoes. 4kg in 3 bags = $\frac{4}{3}$ kg/bag. 12 kg in $x$ bags. To have same weight/bag: $\frac{12}{x} = \frac{4}{3}$. $4 \times 3 = 12$, so $3 \times 3 = 9$. Ans: 9 bags).

**Q1. Brahmagupta's Method:**
*   **a.** $\frac{2}{7} + \frac{5}{7} + \frac{6}{7} = \frac{13}{7}$
*   **b.** $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{9}{12} + \frac{4}{12} = \frac{13}{12}$
*   **c.** $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{4}{6} + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{9}{6} = \frac{3}{2}$

**Q2. Paint Mixture:**
$\frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{17}{12}$ litres ($1 \frac{5}{12}$ litres).

**Q3. Lace:**
Geeta $\frac{2}{5}$, Shamim $\frac{3}{4}$.
Total: $\frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{20} + \frac{15}{20} = \frac{23}{20}$ meters.
Since $\frac{23}{20} > 1$, yes, it is sufficient to cover 1 meter.

    Walk = $\frac{7}{10} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{10} - \frac{5}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}$ km.
*   **b. Jeevika vs Namit:**
    Jeevika: $\frac{10}{3} = \frac{40}{12}$.
    Namit: $\frac{13}{4} = \frac{39}{12}$.
    $\frac{39}{12} < \frac{40}{12}$, so Namit takes less time.
    Difference: $\frac{1}{12}$ minute.

## The Problem

It is easy to add the *same* fractional unit to get 1:
$$ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 $$
$$ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 $$

**Challenge:** Can you write 1 as the sum of **three different** fractional units?

## The Solution

We need three unit fractions:
$$ \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = 1 $$

Let's start with the biggest unit fraction: $\frac{1}{2}$.
Remaining needed: $\frac{1}{2}$.
Now we need two different fractions that add up to $\frac{1}{2}$.
We know $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$, but they must be *different*.

Let's try $\frac{1}{3}$.
$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$.
We are short by $\frac{1}{6}$.
Wait! That's a unit fraction!

So:
$$ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = 1 $$
