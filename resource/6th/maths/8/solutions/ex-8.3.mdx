## Construct (Page 197)

**Q1. Draw a rectangle with sides of length 4 cm and 6 cm.**

**Solution:**
1.  Draw $AB = 6$ cm.
2.  At $A$ and $B$, construct vertical perpendiculars.
3.  Mark $AD = 4$ cm and $BC = 4$ cm on these perpendiculars.
4.  Join $C$ and $D$.
5.  **Check:** Measure $CD$. It should be 6 cm. Measure angles $\angle C$ and $\angle D$. They should be $90^\circ$.

**Q2. Draw a rectangle of sides 2 cm and 10 cm.**

**Solution:**
Follow the same method as above. The rectangle will be long and thin.
*   Sides: $PQ = 10$ cm, $PS = 2$ cm.

**Q3. Is it possible to construct a 4-sided figure where all angles are $90^\circ$ but opposite sides are NOT equal?**

**Answer: No.**
If a quadrilateral has three $90^\circ$ angles, the fourth must be $90^\circ$ (since sum is $360^\circ$). A quadrilateral with four right angles is a rectangle (or square). By definition of a rectangle, opposite sides *must* be equal.

## Exercise 8.4 Exploration (Page 198)

**Data Table:**
Looking at distances of $X$ from $A$ and $Y$ from $B$.

| Distance of X from A | Distance of Y from B | Length of XY |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 mm | 5 mm | **Equal to AB** |
| 1 cm | 1 cm | **Equal to AB** |
| 1 cm 5 mm | 1 cm 5 mm | **Equal to AB** |

**Observation:**
1.  **Length XY:** If $X$ and $Y$ move the same distance from $A$ and $B$, then $XY$ remains parallel to $AB$ and equal in length to $AB$.
2.  **Shape:** The figure $ABYX$ is a rectangle.
