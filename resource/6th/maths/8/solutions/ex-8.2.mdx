## Naming Squares (Page 193)

**Question:** Which of the following is not a name for this square (PQRS)?
1.  PQSR
2.  SPQR
3.  RSPQ
4.  QRSP

**Answer:** **1. PQSR**
*   **Reason:** When naming a polygon, vertices must be listed in consecutive order (perimeter). $PQSR$ jumps from $Q$ to $S$ diagonally, which breaks the order. The other three follow the cyclic order.

## Figure it Out (Page 194)

**Q1. Draw the rectangle and four squares configuration on dot paper.**
*(Practical activity - ensure squares are tilted symmetrically).*

**Q2. Identify if there are any squares in this collection.**
**Answer:** Yes, the rotated figure labeled **A** is a square. Even though it is rotated, its sides are equal (based on the dot spacing) and its corners form $90^\circ$ angles.

**Think:** Is it possible to reason out if sides are equal/angles are right without instruments?
**Answer:** Yes, on a dot grid (lattice), you can count "steps" (e.g., 2 units right, 2 units up) to verify lengths and slopes. If the slopes are negative reciprocals, the lines are perpendicular.

**Q3. Draw at least 3 rotated squares and rectangles.**
*(Self-verification: Ensure opposite sides are parallel and adjacent sides are perpendicular).*
