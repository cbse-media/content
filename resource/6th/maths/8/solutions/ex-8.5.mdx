## Explore (Page 204)

**Q. How should the rectangle be constructed so that the diagonal divides the opposite angles into equal parts?**

**Answer:**
If the diagonal divides the right angle ($90^\circ$) into two equal parts, each part is $45^\circ$.
*   If the angle between the diagonal and the side is $45^\circ$, the triangle formed is an Isosceles Right-Angled Triangle.
*   This implies the adjacent sides are equal.
*   Therefore, the rectangle must be a **Square**.

## Construct (Page 205)

**Q1. Construct a rectangle where the diagonal divides opposite angles into $60^\circ$ and $30^\circ$.**

**Solution:**
1.  Draw a line $AB$ (arbitrary length).
2.  At $A$, construct a $90^\circ$ angle (perpendicular).
3.  We want the diagonal to make $60^\circ$ or $30^\circ$ with $AB$. Let's assume $\angle CAB = 60^\circ$.
4.  Construct a $60^\circ$ angle at $A$.
5.  Extend this line until it hits the perpendicular from $B$ (if constructed that way) or set a specific length.
    *   *Correction based on text method:* Draw triangle $ABC$ with $\angle B = 90^\circ$ and $\angle A = 60^\circ$.
    *   Complete the rectangle by drawing parallel lines from $C$ and $A$.

**Q2. Construct a rectangle where one side is 5 cm and diagonal is 7 cm.**

**Solution:**
See the method in "Topics: Diagonals".
1.  Draw base 5 cm.
2.  Draw perpendicular at one end.
3.  Cut arc of 7 cm from the other end.
