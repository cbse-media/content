## Construct (Page 211)

**House Construction**
*Recreate the figure with all sides 5 cm.*

**Solution:**
1.  **Base:** Draw square $BCDE$ with side 5 cm.
    *   Draw $CD = 5$ cm.
    *   Construct perpendiculars at $C$ and $D$.
    *   Mark $CB = 5$ cm and $DE = 5$ cm.
    *   Join $BE$.
2.  **Roof:** We need point $A$ such that $AB = 5$ cm and $AE = 5$ cm (assuming roof connects to top corners).
    *   Wait, diagram shows the roof on top of side $BC$? No, usually roof is on top. Based on text labels $B, C, D, E$, let's assume $BC$ is the top side of a square.
    *   Draw arcs of radius 5 cm from $B$ and $C$.
    *   Intersection is $A$.
    *   Join $AB$ and $AC$.

**Q3. Is there a 4-sided figure where all sides are equal but it is not a square?**

**Answer:** **Yes, a Rhombus.**
*   A rhombus has 4 equal sides.
*   However, its angles do not have to be $90^\circ$.
*   **Construction:** Draw a base $AB$. Draw $AD$ at an angle (say $60^\circ$) with length equal to $AB$. Complete the parallelogram using compass arcs of the same length from $B$ and $D$.

## Bigger House (Page 215)
**Q1. Construct a bigger house with sides 7 cm.**
**Solution:**
Follow the exact same steps as the 5 cm house, simply changing the ruler length and compass radius to 7 cm.

**Q2. Recreate "Eyes"**
**Solution:**
1.  Draw a horizontal line of length, say, 6 cm ($AB$).
2.  Mark a point $P$ above the line on the perpendicular bisector.
3.  Place compass at $P$, adjust radius to pass through $A$ and $B$. Draw the upper arc.
4.  Mark a point $Q$ below the line (same distance as $P$).
5.  Place compass at $Q$, draw the lower arc connecting $A$ and $B$.
