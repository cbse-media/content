## Question 1: Combined Rectangles

**Problem:** Find dimensions of a rectangle with area equal to sum of ($5 \times 10$) and ($2 \times 7$).
*   Area 1 = 50.
*   Area 2 = 14.
*   Total Area = 64.
*   **Possible Dimensions:**
    *   $8 \times 8$ (Square)
    *   $16 \times 4$
    *   $32 \times 2$
    *   $64 \times 1$

## Question 2: Garden Width

**Problem:** Length 50 m, Area 1000 sq m.
*   Width = $1000 / 50 = 20\text{ m}$.

## Question 3: Carpet Area

**Problem:** Floor ($5 \times 4$), Carpet ($3 \times 3$). Uncarpeted area?
*   (Same as Solved Example).
*   $20 - 9 = 11\text{ sq m}$.

## Question 4: Flower Beds

**Problem:** Garden $15 \times 12$. Four beds ($2 \times 1$) at corners. Area of lawn?
1.  **Total Garden Area:** $15 \times 12 = 180\text{ sq m}$.
2.  **Area of 1 Flower Bed:** $2 \times 1 = 2\text{ sq m}$.
3.  **Total Flower Bed Area:** $4 \times 2 = 8\text{ sq m}$.
4.  **Lawn Area:** $180 - 8 = 172\text{ sq m}$.

## Question 8: Folded Square

**Problem:** A square is folded in half and cut into two rectangles. Which statement is true?
*   **c.** The perimeters of both rectangles added together is always $1\frac{1}{2}$ times the perimeter of the square.

**Proof:**
*   Square side = $s$. Perimeter $P_{sq} = 4s$.
*   Rectangle sides = $s$ and $s/2$.
*   Perimeter of 1 Rectangle = $2(s + s/2) = 2(1.5s) = 3s$.
*   Sum of 2 Rectangles = $3s + 3s = 6s$.
*   Ratio: $6s / 4s = 1.5$ ($1\frac{1}{2}$).
*   **Statement C is True.**
