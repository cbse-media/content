## Question 1: Find the missing terms

**a. Perimeter of a rectangle = 14 cm; breadth = 2 cm; length = ?**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Perimeter} &= 2 \times (l + b) \\
14 &= 2 \times (l + 2) \\
\frac{14}{2} &= l + 2 \\
7 &= l + 2 \\
l &= 7 - 2 = 5\text{ cm}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Answer: Length = 5 cm**

**b. Perimeter of a square = 20 cm; side length = ?**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Perimeter} &= 4 \times s \\
20 &= 4 \times s \\
s &= \frac{20}{4} = 5\text{ cm}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Answer: Side = 5 cm**

**c. Perimeter of a rectangle = 12 m; length = 3 m; breadth = ?**

$$
\begin{aligned}
12 &= 2 \times (3 + b) \\
6 &= 3 + b \\
b &= 6 - 3 = 3\text{ m}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Answer: Breadth = 3 m**

## Question 2: Wire Bending

**Problem:** A rectangle having sidelengths 5 cm and 3 cm is made using a piece of wire. If the wire is straightened and then bent to form a square, what will be the length of a side of the square?

**Solution:**
1.  **Length of Wire:** This is the perimeter of the rectangle.
    $$ P = 2 \times (5 + 3) = 2 \times 8 = 16\text{ cm} $$
2.  **Forming a Square:** The same wire (16 cm) forms the square.
    $$ 4 \times s = 16 $$
    $$ s = \frac{16}{4} = 4\text{ cm} $$
**Answer: 4 cm**

## Question 3: Triangle Side

**Problem:** Find the length of the third side of a triangle having a perimeter of 55 cm and having two sides of length 20 cm and 14 cm.

**Solution:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Perimeter} &= \text{Side}_1 + \text{Side}_2 + \text{Side}_3 \\
55 &= 20 + 14 + \text{Side}_3 \\
55 &= 34 + \text{Side}_3 \\
\text{Side}_3 &= 55 - 34 = 21\text{ cm}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Answer: 21 cm**

## Question 4: Cost of Fencing

**Problem:** What would be the cost of fencing a rectangular park whose length is 150 m and breadth is 120 m, if the fence costs ₹40 per metre?

**Solution:**
1.  **Find Perimeter:**
    $$ P = 2 \times (150 + 120) = 2 \times 270 = 540\text{ m} $$
2.  **Calculate Cost:**
    $$ \text{Cost} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Rate} $$
    $$ \text{Cost} = 540 \times 40 = 21,600 $$
**Answer: ₹21,600**

## Question 5: String Shapes

**Problem:** A string is 36 cm long. Find the side length if it forms:
*   **a. A Square:** $4s = 36 \Rightarrow s = 9\text{ cm}$.
*   **b. An Equilateral Triangle:** $3s = 36 \Rightarrow s = 12\text{ cm}$.
*   **c. A Hexagon:** $6s = 36 \Rightarrow s = 6\text{ cm}$.

## Question 6: Farmer's Field

**Problem:** A rectangular field (230 m by 160 m) is fenced with 3 rounds of rope. Total rope needed?

**Solution:**
1.  **Perimeter of Field:**
    $$ P = 2 \times (230 + 160) = 2 \times 390 = 780\text{ m} $$
2.  **Total Rope (3 rounds):**
    $$ \text{Total} = 3 \times 780 = 2340\text{ m} $$
**Answer: 2340 m**
