## Figure It Out

**Task:** Find the areas of the figures on the grid by dividing them into rectangles and triangles.

*(Note: Grid squares are assumed to be 1 unit).*

**Figure a (Parallelogram-like):**
*   Base = 4 units. Height = 6 units.
*   Area = $4 \times 6 = 24$ sq units.

**Figure b (Trapezoid/Triangle combo):**
*   Decompose into a central rectangle and side triangles.
*   Solution says: **30 sq units**.

**Figure c (Complex Polygon):**
*   Solution says: **48 sq units**.

**Figure d (M-shape/Polygon):**
*   Solution says: **16 sq units**.

**Figure e (Diamond/Kite):**
*   Solution says: **12 sq units**.
*   Calculation: Box it in a rectangle of $4 \times 6 = 24$. The diamond usually takes up half the area of the bounding box if vertices touch the midpoints/sides. $24 / 2 = 12$.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Method:** To solve these on grid paper:
1.  Draw a bounding rectangle around the shape.
2.  Calculate the area of the bounding rectangle.
3.  Calculate the areas of the empty triangles in the corners (using $\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
4.  Subtract the corner areas from the bounding box area.
