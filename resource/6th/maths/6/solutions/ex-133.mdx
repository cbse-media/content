## Matha Pachchi: Akshi vs Toshi

**Scenario:**
*   **Akshi's Track (Outer):** Rectangle $70\text{ m} \times 40\text{ m}$.
*   **Toshi's Track (Inner):** Rectangle $60\text{ m} \times 30\text{ m}$.

**1. Total distance Akshi covered in 5 rounds:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Perimeter (Akshi)} &= 2 \times (70 + 40) = 2 \times 110 = 220\text{ m} \\
\text{Distance} &= 5 \times 220 = 1100\text{ m}
\end{aligned}
$$

**2. Total distance Toshi covered in 7 rounds:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Perimeter (Toshi)} &= 2 \times (60 + 30) = 2 \times 90 = 180\text{ m} \\
\text{Distance} &= 7 \times 180 = 1260\text{ m}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Conclusion:** Toshi ran a longer distance ($1260 > 1100$).

## Deep Dive (Page 134)

**Problem:** Two square tracks, Inner (100m side) and Outer (150m side). Common finish line. Race length is 350m. Where should they start?

**Analysis:**
*   Race distance needed: 350 m.
*   The finish line is in the middle of a side. Let's analyze the path backwards from the finish line.
*   **Inner Runner (A):**
    *   Side length = 100 m.
    *   Path to finish: Half side (50m) + Full Side (100m) + Full Side (100m) + Full Side (100m) = 350m.
    *   This means runner A starts exactly at the finish line (completes exactly 1 round minus 50m? No, $350 = 3.5 \times 100$).
    *   Actually, let's look at the solution provided: "From point A to flag: $100+100+100+50 = 350$". This implies starting at a corner or specific point.
*   **Outer Runner (B):**
    *   Side length = 150 m.
    *   Path: $75 \text{ (half side)} + 150 + 125$?
    *   Solution says: $125 + 150 + 75 = 350$.
    *   $75$ is the final stretch (half side). $150$ is one full side. $125$ is the start of the side ($150 - 25$?).
    *   Actually, $125 + 150 + 75 = 350$. This means they run 1 full side ($150$), one half side ($75$) to finish, and start $125$m back.

**Akshi vs Toshi Triangle Debate (Page 134)**
*   **Akshi:** Perimeter is 9 units.
*   **Toshi:** It's more than 9 units.
*   **Reasoning:** The diagonal of a square is longer than its side. The "slanted" lines in the triangle on the grid are diagonals of the grid squares. Their length is greater than 1 unit. Therefore, the sum is greater than just counting grid lines. Toshi is correct.
