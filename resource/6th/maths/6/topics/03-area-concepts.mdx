## What is Area?

The **area** is the amount of surface or region enclosed by a closed figure. It is usually measured in **square units** (e.g., $cm^2$, $m^2$).

Think of area as the number of unit squares (squares of side 1 unit) needed to cover the surface completely.

### Area of a Rectangle

To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its two dimensions: length and breadth.

$$
\text{Area of a Rectangle} = \text{Length} \times \text{Breadth}
$$

<div class="flex justify-center my-6">
  <svg width="200" height="120" viewBox="0 0 200 120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <rect x="10" y="10" width="180" height="100" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2"/>
    {/* Grid hint */}
    <path d="M 10 110 L 190 110 M 190 10 L 190 110" stroke="currentColor" stroke-dasharray="4,4" opacity="0.5"/>
    <text x="100" y="60" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor" font-size="16">Area = l × b</text>
    <text x="100" y="130" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor" font-size="12">Length (l)</text>
    <text x="-5" y="60" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor" font-size="12" transform="rotate(-90, -5, 60)">Breadth (b)</text>
  </svg>
</div>

### Area of a Square

Since a square is a rectangle where length equals breadth, the formula simplifies:

$$
\text{Area of a Square} = \text{side} \times \text{side} = (\text{side})^2
$$

### Example Problem

**Problem:** A floor is $5\text{ m}$ long and $4\text{ m}$ wide. A square carpet of side $3\text{ m}$ is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor not carpeted.

**Solution:**
1.  Area of Floor = $5 \times 4 = 20\text{ m}^2$.
2.  Area of Carpet = $3 \times 3 = 9\text{ m}^2$.
3.  Area Not Carpeted = Area of Floor - Area of Carpet = $20 - 9 = 11\text{ m}^2$.
