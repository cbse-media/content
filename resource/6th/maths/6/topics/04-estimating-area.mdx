## The Grid Method

We can estimate the area of simple closed shapes (even curved ones like leaves) using squared paper or graph paper where every square measures $1 \text{ unit} \times 1 \text{ unit}$.

### The Rules of Estimation

1.  **Full Squares:** Count full squares as **1 sq unit**.
2.  **Half Squares:** Count exact half squares as **$\frac{1}{2}$ sq unit**.
3.  **More than Half:** If a shape covers more than half of a square, count it as **1 sq unit**.
4.  **Less than Half:** If a shape covers less than half of a square, **ignore it** (count as 0).

<div class="flex justify-center my-6">
  <svg width="300" height="200" viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <defs>
      <pattern id="grid" width="20" height="20" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
        <path d="M 20 0 L 0 0 0 20" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="0.5" opacity="0.3"/>
      </pattern>
    </defs>
    <rect width="300" height="200" fill="url(#grid)" />

    {/* Irregular Shape */}
    <path d="M 100 40 Q 160 20 200 60 T 220 140 T 120 160 T 60 100 Z" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2"/>
    <text x="150" y="110" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor" font-size="14">Irregular Shape</text>

</div>

### Why not use circles?
Squares pack tightly without gaps. Circles leave gaps between them, making it impossible to cover a surface completely to measure area accurately. This is why standard units of area are squares ($m^2$, $cm^2$).
