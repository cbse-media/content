## Relationship between Rectangle and Triangle

If you draw a diagonal across a rectangle, you divide it into two identical triangles.

*   The two triangles overlap exactly.
*   Therefore, their areas are equal.
*   Area of each triangle = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ Area of the Rectangle.

<div class="flex justify-center my-6">
  <svg width="300" height="150" viewBox="0 0 300 150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <rect x="50" y="20" width="200" height="100" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2"/>
    <line x1="50" y1="120" x2="250" y2="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-dasharray="5,5"/>
    <text x="100" y="100" fill="currentColor" font-size="14">Triangle 1</text>
    <text x="180" y="50" fill="currentColor" font-size="14">Triangle 2</text>

</div>

### Generalizing for Any Triangle

Even if the triangle is not a right-angled triangle (formed by the diagonal of a rectangle), we can often split it or box it into rectangles to find its area.

**Key Concept:**
The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and the perpendicular height.

$$
\text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
$$

*(Note: In this specific chapter, the text focuses heavily on the grid method and the "half-rectangle" concept rather than just memorizing the $1/2 \times b \times h$ formula immediately, encouraging visual understanding.)*
