## Page 56: Figure It Out

**Q1. Can the children rearrange themselves so that the children standing at the ends say ‘2’?**
**Answer:** No.
**Reasoning:** A child says '2' only if *both* neighbors are taller. Children at the ends of the line only have *one* neighbor. Therefore, they can say '0' (if taller than neighbor) or '1' (if shorter), but never '2'.

**Q2. Can we arrange the children in a line so that all would say only 0s?**
**Answer:** Yes.
**Reasoning:** If all children are of the **exact same height**, then no neighbor is taller. The definition of '0' is "neither neighbor is taller".

**Q4. There are 5 children of different heights. Can they stand such that four say ‘1’ and the last says ‘0’?**
**Answer:** Yes.
**Arrangement:** Ascending order (Shortest to Tallest).
-   Child 1 (Shortest): Neighbor is taller. Says **1**.
-   Child 2: Left is shorter, Right is taller. 1 neighbor taller. Says **1**.
-   Child 3: Left is shorter, Right is taller. 1 neighbor taller. Says **1**.
-   Child 4: Left is shorter, Right is taller. 1 neighbor taller. Says **1**.
-   Child 5 (Tallest): Left is shorter. No right neighbor. 0 neighbors taller. Says **0**.

**Q7. How would you rearrange five children so maximum number say '2'?**
**Answer:**
We want as many "valleys" (short children between tall ones) as possible.
Arrangement: **Tall - Short - Tall - Short - Tall**
-   Ends (Tall): Say 0.
-   Inner Shorts: Both neighbors are Tall. They say **2**.
-   Inner Tall (Middle): Both neighbors are Short. Says 0.
Max number of '2's is **2**.
