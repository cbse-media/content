## Page 64: Figure It Out

**Q1. Pratibha's Digits: 4, 7, 3, 2**
Smallest: 2347, Largest: 7432.
Diff: 5085, Sum: 9779.

**a. Diff between largest/smallest > 5085:**
Try digits: 9, 1, 2, 3.
Largest: 9321. Smallest: 1239.
Diff: $9321 - 1239 = 8082$ (> 5085).

**Q2. Sum of smallest and largest 5-digit palindrome?**
-   Smallest 5-digit palindrome: **10001**.
-   Largest 5-digit palindrome: **99999**.
-   **Sum:** $10001 + 99999 = 110,000$.
-   **Difference:** $99999 - 10001 = 89,998$.

**Q3. Time is 10:01. Next palindrome?**
-   Next is **11:11**.
-   Minutes between 10:01 and 11:11 = 59 min (to 11:00) + 11 min = **70 minutes**.
-   One after that? **12:21**.
-   Time from 11:11 to 12:21 = 49 min (to 12:00) + 21 min = **70 minutes**.

**Q4. Rounds for 5683 to reach Kaprekar?**
1.  $8653 - 3568 = 5085$
2.  $8550 - 0558$ (Correction: use 5085 digits: 8,5,5,0) $\to 8550 - 0558 = 7992$
3.  $9972 - 2799 = 7173$
4.  $7731 - 1377 = 6354$
5.  $6543 - 3456 = 3087$
6.  $8730 - 0378 = 8352$
7.  $8532 - 2358 = 6174$
**Answer:** It takes about 7-8 steps (Textbook answer key says 8).
