## Challenge 1: The Lychrel Number
We learned that 196 might never become a palindrome.
**Try the Reverse-and-Add process on 196 for 5 steps.**
1.  $196 + 691 = 887$
2.  $887 + 788 = 1675$
3.  $1675 + 5761 = 7436$
4.  $7436 + 6347 = 13783$
5.  $13783 + 38731 = 52514$
Does it look like it's getting closer? The numbers just get bigger!

## Challenge 2: Supercell Grid Design
Design a $3 \times 3$ grid using numbers 1 to 9 (used once each) such that there are **5 supercells**.
Is it possible?
-   To be a supercell, a number must be larger than neighbors.
-   Checkerboard pattern: Corners (4) + Center (1) = 5 cells.
-   Place $9, 8, 7, 6, 5$ in the "Super" positions (Corners and Center).
-   Place $1, 2, 3, 4$ in the "Edge" positions.
-   Check: Center (5) must be larger than Edge neighbors (1,2,3,4). Yes!
-   Corners (9,8,7,6) are definitely larger than neighbors (1,2,3,4).

**Solution Grid:**
$$
\begin{matrix}
9 & 1 & 8 \\
2 & 5 & 3 \\
7 & 4 & 6
\end{matrix}
$$
(Verify: 5 is > 1,2,3,4? Yes. 9 > 1,2? Yes. etc.)

## Challenge 3: Mental Math
Calculate $999 \times 6$ without standard multiplication.
**Strategy:**
$$ 999 = 1000 - 1 $$
$$ (1000 - 1) \times 6 = 6000 - 6 = 5994 $$

Try: $34 \times 11$.
**Strategy:** Split the 3 and 4, sum them (7), place in middle.
$$ 374 $$
