## The Simple Rule

Start with any whole number $n$.
1.  If $n$ is **even**, divide it by 2 ($n/2$).
2.  If $n$ is **odd**, multiply it by 3 and add 1 ($3n + 1$).
3.  Repeat.

### Example Sequence
Start with **12**:
1.  12 is even $\rightarrow 6$
2.  6 is even $\rightarrow 3$
3.  3 is odd $\rightarrow (3 \times 3) + 1 = 10$
4.  10 is even $\rightarrow 5$
5.  5 is odd $\rightarrow (3 \times 5) + 1 = 16$
6.  16 is even $\rightarrow 8$
7.  8 is even $\rightarrow 4$
8.  4 is even $\rightarrow 2$
9.  2 is even $\rightarrow 1$

The sequence is: $12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1$.

## The Unsolved Mystery
The German mathematician **Lothar Collatz** conjectured that **every starting number eventually reaches 1**.
However, no one has been able to prove this is true for *every* number, nor has anyone found a number that *doesn't* reach 1.

<Callout variant="info">
**Try it:** Start with 7. The path is quite long!
$7 \to 22 \to 11 \to 34 \to 17 \to 52 \to 26 \to 13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1$.
