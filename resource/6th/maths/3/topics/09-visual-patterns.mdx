## Summing Patterns

Consider a square grid of numbers where the outer layer is all 40s, the next is 50s, etc.
Instead of adding one by one, use **multiplication**.

### Example: The "40-50" Square
Imagine a grid:
-   4 corners are 40.
-   Edges between corners have 40.
-   Center has 50s.

**Method:** Count how many 40s and how many 50s.
$$ \text{Total} = (\text{Count of 40} \times 40) + (\text{Count of 50} \times 50) $$

## Hexagonal Patterns
Look at this hexagonal expansion.

<div class="flex justify-center my-6">
  <svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="0 0 200 200">
    <polygon points="100,20 170,55 170,145 100,180 30,145 30,55" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"/>
    <text x="100" y="100" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">15</text>
    <text x="100" y="50" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">25</text>
    <text x="100" y="150" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">25</text>
    <text x="50" y="75" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">25</text>
    <text x="150" y="75" text-anchor="middle" fill="currentColor">25</text>
  </svg>
</div>

The numbers often follow a rule:
-   **Sum of vertices?**
-   **Difference between layers?**

In the textbook example (Page 14), we see $35$ surrounded by $25$s, surrounded by $15$s.
The rule might be $15 \times 6$ (outer) $+ 25 \times 6$ (inner) $+ 35$ (center).

**Optimization:** Always look for symmetry. If a number appears 6 times in a ring, calculate $6 \times N$ rather than $N+N+N+N+N+N$.
