## Clock Patterns
Digital clocks show patterns like:
-   **Repeated Digits:** $11:11, 22:22$ (on 24h clock), $4:44$.
-   **Palindromic Times:** $10:01, 12:21, 05:50$.

### Problem: Next Palindrome
If the time is **10:01**, when is the next palindromic time?
1.  The hours are 10. The only palindrome with 10 is 10:01.
2.  Next hour is 11. Palindromes: $11:11$.
3.  Difference: from 10:01 to 11:11 is **1 hour 10 minutes** (70 minutes).

## Calendar Patterns
Dates can also be palindromes (e.g., **11/02/2011** reads the same forwards and backwards if we ignore slashes).

**Calendar Repetition:**
Did you know calendars repeat?
-   A standard year calendar repeats every 11 years (usually).
-   The entire cycle of dates and days repeats every 28 years (guaranteed).

**Activity:** Find a date where the digits repeat in a pattern, like 20/12/2012 (2, 0, 1, 2 repeats).
