## The Game of 21

**Rules:**
1.  Start at 0.
2.  Two players take turns adding 1, 2, or 3 to the count.
3.  The player who reaches **21** wins.

### Winning Strategy
To ensure you reach 21, you must be the one to reach **17**.
Why? If you are at 17:
-   Opponent adds 1 $\to$ 18. You add 3 $\to$ 21.
-   Opponent adds 2 $\to$ 19. You add 2 $\to$ 21.
-   Opponent adds 3 $\to$ 20. You add 1 $\to$ 21.

To reach 17, you must reach **13**.
To reach 13, you must reach **9**.
To reach 9, you must reach **5**.
To reach 5, you must reach **1**.

**Strategy:**
-   Go first.
-   Say **1**.
-   Whatever the opponent adds ($x$), you add ($4-x$).
-   This ensures you land on multiples of 4 plus 1: $1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21$.

## General Rule
If the target is $T$ and you can add numbers $1$ to $k$:
The winning positions are multiples of $(k+1)$.
-   If $T$ is a multiple of $(k+1)$, the second player wins (if they play perfectly).
-   If $T$ is not a multiple, the first player wins by taking the remainder of $T \div (k+1)$.
