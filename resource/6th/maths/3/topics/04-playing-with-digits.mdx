## Digit Sums

A **digit sum** is found by adding all the digits of a number together.

**Example:**
For the number $176$:
$$ 1 + 7 + 6 = 14 $$

For the number $68$:
$$ 6 + 8 = 14 $$

Interestingly, different numbers can have the same digit sum.

### Properties
-   **Smallest Number with Digit Sum 14:** To make the number small, we want fewer digits. To use fewer digits, we use the largest possible digits (9).
    -   $14 - 9 = 5$. So digits are 5 and 9.
    -   Smallest order: $59$.
-   **Largest 5-digit number with Digit Sum 14:** We want the largest digits at the start.
    -   $9, \dots$ (Remaining sum 5)
    -   $95000$ (Sum: $9+5+0+0+0 = 14$).

### Consecutive Digits Pattern
Calculate digit sums for consecutive digits:
1.  $123 \rightarrow 1+2+3 = 6$
2.  $234 \rightarrow 2+3+4 = 9$
3.  $345 \rightarrow 3+4+5 = 12$

**Observation:** The sums increase by 3 each time. This is because each digit in the sequence increases by 1 ($1 \to 2$, $2 \to 3$, $3 \to 4$), so the total sum increases by $1+1+1 = 3$.
