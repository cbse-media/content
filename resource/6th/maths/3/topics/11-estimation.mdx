## Why Estimate?
We don't always need the exact number.
-   "About 500 students in the school" is easier to handle than "487 students".

## Estimation Strategies

1.  **Sampling:** Count a small section and multiply.
    -   *Example:* Count students in one class (30) and multiply by number of classes (10) $\approx 300$.
2.  **Visualizing:** Compare to a known quantity.
    -   *Example:* A bucket holds 20 liters. A tank looks like it holds 50 buckets. Tank $\approx 1000$ liters.

### Exercise
**Estimate the number of words in a page:**
1.  Count words in one line ($\approx 10$).
2.  Count lines on the page ($\approx 30$).
3.  Estimate: $10 \times 30 = 300$ words.

**Fermi Problems:** These are estimation questions like "How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?" or "How many times do you blink in a year?" They rely on chaining logical estimates together.
