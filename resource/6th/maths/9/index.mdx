# Symmetry

Look around you! From the petals of a flower to the wings of a butterfly, and even in man-made structures like the Taj Mahal, symmetry is everywhere. Symmetry brings balance, harmony, and beauty to the objects we see.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical definitions of symmetry, learn how to identify lines of symmetry, and understand how objects can have symmetry even when they are rotating.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Line of Symmetry** | A line that divides a figure into two identical halves that overlap exactly when folded. | A butterfly, the letter 'A'. |
| **Reflection Symmetry** | Another name for line symmetry, where one half is the mirror image of the other. | Looking in a mirror. |
| **Rotational Symmetry** | When a figure looks exactly the same after being rotated by a certain angle (less than 360°) around a fixed point. | A windmill, a ceiling fan. |
| **Centre of Rotation** | The fixed point around which a figure is rotated. | The center of a wheel. |
| **Angle of Symmetry** | The specific angle at which a figure looks the same after rotation. | A square has angles of 90°, 180°, 270°, 360°. |

## Formula Sheet

### Rotational Symmetry
For a regular polygon with $n$ sides:
1.  **Number of Lines of Symmetry:** $n$
2.  **Order of Rotational Symmetry:** $n$
3.  **Smallest Angle of Symmetry:** $\frac{360^{\circ}}{n}$

$$
\text{Angle of Symmetry} = \frac{360^{\circ}}{\text{Order of Symmetry}}
$$
