## Figure it Out (Page 219)

**1. Do you see any line of symmetry in the figures at the start of the chapter? What about in the picture of the cloud?**

**Answer:**
*   **Flower:** Yes, it has 6 lines of symmetry (one through each petal).
*   **Rangoli:** Yes, it has 4 lines of symmetry.
*   **Butterfly:** Yes, it has 1 vertical line of symmetry.
*   **Pinwheel:** No, it has no line of symmetry (it has rotational symmetry, but you cannot fold it to match).
*   **Cloud:** No, clouds are irregular shapes and do not have a line of symmetry.

**2. For each of the following figures, identify the line(s) of symmetry if it exists.**

*Referencing the shapes provided in the textbook (Kite, Rhombus, Trapezoid, Triangle).*

**Solution:**

    <svg width="400" height="150" viewBox="0 0 400 150">
        {/* Shape 1: Arrowhead/Kite pointing left */}

</div>

*   **Shape 1 (Arrowhead):** 1 horizontal line of symmetry.
*   **Shape 2 (Kite):** 1 vertical line of symmetry.
*   **Shape 3 (Isosceles Trapezoid):** 1 vertical line of symmetry.
*   **Shape 4 (L-Shape):** 1 line of symmetry along the diagonal corner (assuming legs are equal length).
