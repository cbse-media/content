## Exercises (Page 228)

**8. Find the lines of symmetry for the kolam below.**

The Kolam is a star-like pattern made of overlapping diamonds and squares.
**Answer:** It has **6** lines of symmetry (3 passing through the vertices, 3 passing between the vertices) due to its hexagonal structure.

**9. Draw the following triangles:**

*   **a. A triangle with exactly one line of symmetry.**
    *   **Solution:** An Isosceles Triangle (but not equilateral).
*   **b. A triangle with exactly three lines of symmetry.**
    *   **Solution:** An Equilateral Triangle.
*   **c. A triangle with no line of symmetry.**
    *   **Solution:** A Scalene Triangle (all sides different lengths).

**Question:** Is it possible to draw a triangle with exactly two lines of symmetry?
**Answer:** **No.** If a triangle has two lines of symmetry, the third median must also be a line of symmetry, making it an equilateral triangle with three lines. You cannot have exactly two.

**10. Draw figures with curved boundaries:**

*   **a. Exactly one line of symmetry:** A semi-circle or a mushroom shape.
*   **b. Exactly two lines of symmetry:** An ellipse (oval) or a figure-8 shape.
*   **c. Exactly four lines of symmetry:** A flower with 4 petals or a shape like a clover.

**11. Copy on squared paper. Complete them so that the blue line is a line of symmetry.**
