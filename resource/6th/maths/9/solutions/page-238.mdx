## Figure it Out (Page 238)

**1. Colour the sectors of the circle:**
The circle is divided into 12 sectors.

*   **i) 3 angles of symmetry:** You need Order 3. $12 \div 3 = 4$. You must repeat a pattern every 4 sectors.
    *   *Example:* Color sectors 1, 5, 9.
*   **ii) 4 angles of symmetry:** You need Order 4. $12 \div 4 = 3$. Repeat pattern every 3 sectors.
    *   *Example:* Color sectors 1, 4, 7, 10.
*   **iii) Possible numbers of angles:**
    *   The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. You can create symmetries of these orders.

**2. Draw figures other than a circle and square that have both reflection and rotational symmetry.**
*   **Regular Pentagon:** 5 lines of symmetry, Order 5 rotation.
*   **Regular Hexagon:** 6 lines of symmetry, Order 6 rotation.
*   **Rectangle:** 2 lines of symmetry, Order 2 rotation ($180^{\circ}$).

**3. Draw rough sketches:**
*   **a. Triangle with at least 2 lines and 2 angles:** Equilateral Triangle (3 lines, 3 angles).
*   **b. Triangle with 1 line but no rotational symmetry:** Isosceles Triangle.
*   **c. Quadrilateral with rotational symmetry but no reflection:** Parallelogram.
*   **d. Quadrilateral with reflection but no rotational:** Isosceles Trapezoid or a Kite.

**4. Smallest angle is 60°. What are the others?**
Multiples of 60: $120^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}, 240^{\circ}, 300^{\circ}, 360^{\circ}$.

**5. 60° is an angle. Two angles are less than 60°. What is the smallest?**
If 60 is a symmetry angle, the smallest angle must be a factor of 60.
If there are exactly two angles less than 60 (say $x$ and $2x$), and $3x = 60$, then $x=20$.
Angles: $20^{\circ}, 40^{\circ}, 60^{\circ} \dots$
**Answer:** $20^{\circ}$.

**6. Can a figure have rotational symmetry with smallest angle:**
*   **a. 45°?** Yes, because $360 \div 45 = 8$ (whole number). It would be an octagon.
*   **b. 17°?** No, because $360 \div 17 = 21.17$ (not a whole number).
