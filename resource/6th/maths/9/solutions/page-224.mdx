## Exercises (Page 224)

**1. In each of the following figures, a hole was punched in a folded square sheet of paper and then the paper was unfolded. Identify the line along which the paper was folded.**

The positions of the holes tell us where the fold line (line of symmetry) must be. The fold line is always exactly halfway between the two matching holes.

*   **(a)** Holes are side-by-side horizontally. **Fold:** Vertical line.
*   **(b)** Holes are at diagonal corners. **Fold:** Diagonal line.
*   **(c)** Holes are stacked vertically. **Fold:** Horizontal line.
*   **(d)** Only one hole is visible, but the question implies unfolding. If the figure creates 4 holes from one punch, it was folded twice (vertically then horizontally). If it implies a single fold for a single hole, the question asks "How was it folded?" - For figure (d) in the solution key, it indicates folds vertically and horizontally to create the pattern shown in answers.

**2. Given the line(s) of symmetry, find the other hole(s):**

We need to "reflect" the existing hole across the dotted line.

**3 & 4. Paper Cutting Predictions**

**(a)** Vertical fold, cut a triangle pointing right.
*   **Result:** When opened, you get a diamond or rhombus shape in the center.

**(b)** Horizontal fold, cut a pattern on the edge.
*   **Result:** The pattern mirrors on the top and bottom.
