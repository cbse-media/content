**Q. Is it always easy to compare two angles?**
**Answer:** No, it is not always easy to compare two angles (like $89^\circ$ and $91^\circ$) without measuring or overlapping (superimposition). However, for obviously different sizes, comparison is easy.

## Figure it Out (Page 23)

**Q1. Fold a rectangular sheet of paper, then draw a line along the fold created... Compare angles.**

**Solution:**
*   Angles formed: $\angle AEF, \angle BEF, \angle DFE, \angle CFE$.
*   $\angle AEF$ and $\angle CFE$ are larger than $\angle BEF$ and $\angle DFE$ in standard oblique folds.
*   (Activity based: Try folding rectangular sheets in different ways).

**Q2. In each case, determine which angle is greater and why.**
*   a. $\angle AOB$ or $\angle XOY$
*   b. $\angle AOB$ or $\angle XOB$
*   c. $\angle XOB$ or $\angle XOC$

**Solution:**
*   (a) $\angle AOB$ is greater. $\angle XOY$ is an acute angle contained within $\angle AOB$.
*   (b) $\angle AOB$ is greater (it contains $\angle XOB$).
*   (c) None. $\angle XOB$ is the same as $\angle XOC$ if $B$ and $C$ are on the same ray.

**Q3. Which angle is greater: $\angle XOY$ or $\angle AOB$?**

**Solution:**
*   By simply looking at the figure, it might be hard to say. **Superimposition** or **measurement** is necessary to be exact.
