## Figure it Out (Page 15)

**Q1. Can you help Rihan and Sheetal find their answers?**
*   **Rihan:** Rihan marked a point on a piece of paper. How many lines can he draw that pass through the point?
*   **Sheetal:** Sheetal marked two points on a piece of paper. How many different lines can she draw that pass through both of the points?

**Solution:**
*   **Rihan's Answer:** Rihan can draw **many (uncountable)** number of lines through a single given point.
*   **Sheetal's Answer:** Sheetal can draw **only one unique line** through the two given points.

## Exercise Questions (Page 16)

**Q2. Name the line segments in Fig. 2.4. Which of the five marked points are on exactly one of the line segments? Which are on two of the line segments?**

**Solution:**
*   **Line Segments:** $\overline{LM}, \overline{MP}, \overline{PQ}, \overline{QR}$.
*   **Points on exactly one segment:** Points $L$ and $R$.
*   **Points on two segments:** Points $M, P$, and $Q$.

**Q3. Name the rays shown in Fig. 2.5. Is T the starting point of each of these rays?**

**Solution:**
*   **Rays:** $\overrightarrow{TA}, \overrightarrow{TB}, \overrightarrow{TN}, \overrightarrow{NB}$.
*   **Is T the starting point?**
    *   No. $T$ is the starting point for $\overrightarrow{TB}, \overrightarrow{TN}$, and $\overrightarrow{TA}$.
    *   $T$ is **not** the starting point for $\overrightarrow{NB}$ (Start point is $N$).

**Q4. Draw a rough figure and write labels appropriately to illustrate each of the following:**
a. $\overrightarrow{OP}$ and $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ meet at $O$.
b. $\overleftrightarrow{XY}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$ intersect at point $M$.
c. Line $l$ contains points $E$ and $F$ but not point $D$.
d. Point $P$ lies on $\overline{AB}$.

**Solution:**
*(Refer to visual descriptions below based on standard geometric conventions)*
*   (a) Two rays starting from a common point $O$.
*   (b) Two lines crossing each other like an 'X' at point $M$.
*   (c) A straight line with dots $E$ and $F$ on it, and a dot $D$ floating outside the line.
*   (d) A line segment with ends $A$ and $B$, and a dot $P$ somewhere on the line between them.

**Q5. In Fig. 2.6, name:**
a. Five points
b. A line
c. Four rays
d. Five line segments

**Solution:**
*   **a. Five points:** $D, E, O, B, C$.
*   **b. A line:** $\overleftrightarrow{DE}$ or $\overleftrightarrow{DO}$ or $\overleftrightarrow{DB}$ or $\overleftrightarrow{EO}$ or $\overleftrightarrow{EB}$ or $\overleftrightarrow{OB}$. (They represent the same line).
*   **c. Four rays:** $\overrightarrow{OC}, \overrightarrow{OB}, \overrightarrow{OE}, \overrightarrow{OD}$.
*   **d. Five line segments:** $\overline{DE}, \overline{DO}, \overline{DB}, \overline{EO}, \overline{EB}$. (Others like $\overline{OB}, \overline{OC}$ are also possible).

**Q6. Here is a ray OA (Fig. 2.7). It starts at O and passes through the point A. It also passes through the point B.**
a. Can you also name it as $\overrightarrow{OB}$? Why?
b. Can we write $\overrightarrow{OA}$ as $\overrightarrow{AO}$? Why or why not?

**Solution:**
*   **a. Yes.** Since $O$ is the starting point and point $B$ lies on the ray that goes endlessly in the direction of $A$, $\overrightarrow{OB}$ represents the same ray as $\overrightarrow{OA}$. $\overrightarrow{OA}$ is an extension of $\overrightarrow{OB}$.
*   **b. No.** $\overrightarrow{OA}$ is a ray starting at $O$ and going towards $A$. $\overrightarrow{AO}$ would represent a ray starting at $A$ and going towards $O$. They have different starting points and directions.
