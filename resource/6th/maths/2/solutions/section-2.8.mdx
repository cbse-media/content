**Q. Is it possible to draw $\overrightarrow{OC}$ such that the two angles are equal to each other in size?**
**Answer:** Yes. When $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$ overlap each other (folding the straight angle), the crease $\overrightarrow{OC}$ divides the straight angle $\angle AOB$ into two equal-sized angles ($90^\circ$ each).

**Q. If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn, how much of a full turn will form a right angle?**
**Answer:** $\frac{1}{4}$ of a full turn.

**Q4. Get a slanting crease on the paper. Now, try to get another crease that is perpendicular to the slanting crease.**
*   **a.** How many right angles do you have now? Justify.
*   **b.** Describe how you folded.

**Solution:**
*   **a.** Four right angles. Each angle is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the complete angle (full turn).
*   **b.** (Activity) Fold the paper once to make the slanting line. Then fold the paper onto itself so the line lies exactly on top of itself. The new crease is perpendicular.

**Q2. Make a few acute angles and a few obtuse angles.**
**Solution:**
*   **Acute:** Like arrowheads pointing sharply ($\angle < 90^\circ$).
*   **Obtuse:** Wide "arms" like a clock at 5 o'clock ($\angle > 90^\circ$).

**Q3. Why do you think words acute and obtuse were chosen?**
**Answer:** Acute means "sharp" (small opening). Obtuse means "blunt" (wide opening).

**Q4. Find out the number of acute angles in each figure. Pattern?**
**Solution:**
*   Fig 1 (Triangle): **3** acute angles.
*   Fig 2: **12** acute angles.
*   Fig 3: **21** acute angles.
*   **Pattern:** $3 \times 0 + ?$... The solution text suggests a pattern based on inner triangles: $3, 12, 21...$
*   Next figure: **30** acute angles.
