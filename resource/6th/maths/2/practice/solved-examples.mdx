## Mind the Mistake (Protractor Errors)

Students often make mistakes when reading a protractor. Let's analyze the errors from Page 32.

### Case 1: $\angle U = 35^\circ$?
**Mistake:** The student placed the baseline on the edge of the protractor plastic, not the $0^\circ$ line.
**Correction:** Align the arm of the angle exactly with the $0^\circ$ - $180^\circ$ line.

### Case 2: $\angle V = 80^\circ$?
**Mistake:** The vertex of the angle is NOT at the center point of the protractor.
**Correction:** Place the center of the protractor's base exactly on the vertex.

### Case 3: $\angle W = 70^\circ$?
**Mistake:** Reading the wrong scale. The angle is obtuse (wide), but $70^\circ$ is acute.
**Correction:** Read the scale that starts at $0^\circ$ on the side of the arm. The correct measure is $110^\circ$.

### Case 4: $\angle Z = 85^\circ$?
**Mistake:** The baseline is not aligned with either arm.
**Correction:** Rotate the protractor so the $0^\circ$ line lies flat on one of the arms.

## Triangle Angle Sum Conjecture

**Experiment:**
If you measure the three angles of *any* triangle (like in Page 31), and add them up, what do you get?

$$
\text{Sum} = \angle A + \angle B + \angle C
$$

**Result:** You will find the sum is always very close to or exactly **$180^\circ$**.
