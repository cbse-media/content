## Introduction

In this chapter, we explore the basic ideas of **plane geometry**. These concepts—points, lines, rays, line segments, and angles—are the building blocks for understanding shapes, constructions, and the world around us.

From the tip of a pencil to the hands of a clock, geometry is everywhere!

## Key Concepts Overview

*   **Point:** A precise location with no dimensions (length, breadth, or height).
*   **Line Segment:** The shortest path between two points. It has a definite length.
*   **Line:** A line segment extended endlessly in both directions.
*   **Ray:** A portion of a line starting at a point and going endlessly in one direction.
*   **Angle:** Formed by two rays (arms) sharing a common starting point (vertex).

## Formula Sheet & Summary

| Concept | Symbol / Notation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Point** | Point $P$ | A dot representing a location. |
| **Line Segment** | $\overline{AB}$ | Has two end points ($A, B$). Definite length. |
| **Line** | $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ or line $l$ | No end points. Extends forever in both directions. |
| **Ray** | $\overrightarrow{AB}$ | One starting point ($A$). Extends forever in one direction ($B$). |
| **Angle** | $\angle ABC$ or $\angle B$ | Measured in degrees ($^\circ$). $B$ is the vertex. |
