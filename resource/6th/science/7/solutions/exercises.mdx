## Let us enhance our learning

**Q1. The normal temperature of a healthy human being is close to...**
(i) $98.6^\circ C$
(ii) $37.0^\circ C$
(iii) $32.0^\circ C$
(iv) $27.0^\circ C$

**Answer:** (ii) $37.0^\circ C$
> **Explanation:** The normal human body temperature is approximately $37.0^\circ C$. Note that $98.6$ is correct only if the scale is Fahrenheit ($^\circ F$), but option (i) says $^\circ C$, which would be boiling hot!

---

**Q2. $37^\circ C$ is the same temperature as...**
(i) $97.4^\circ F$
(ii) $97.6^\circ F$
(iii) $98.4^\circ F$
(iv) $98.6^\circ F$

**Answer:** (iv) $98.6^\circ F$
> **Explanation:** This is the standard conversion for normal body temperature.

**Q3. Fill in the blanks:**
(i) The hotness or coldness of a system is determined by its \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
(ii) The temperature of ice-cold water cannot be measured by a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ thermometer.
(iii) The unit of temperature is degree \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**Answer:**
(i) Temperature
(ii) Clinical (Because the range of a clinical thermometer is 35-42°C, and ice is 0°C).
(iii) Celsius (or Fahrenheit)

---

**Q4. The range of a laboratory thermometer is usually...**
(i) $10^\circ C$ to $100^\circ C$
(ii) $-10^\circ C$ to $110^\circ C$
(iii) $32^\circ C$ to $45^\circ C$
(iv) $35^\circ C$ to $42^\circ C$

**Answer:** (ii) $-10^\circ C$ to $110^\circ C$

---

**Q5. Who do you think followed the correct way for measuring temperature?**
*Refer to Figure 7.6 in textbook (Student 1: Tilted, Student 2: Not immersed properly, Student 3: Touching bottom, Student 4: Vertical and suspended).*

**Answer:** (iv) Student 4
> **Explanation:**
> - Student 1 is holding it tilted.
> - Student 2 is holding it too high (bulb barely touches water).
> - Student 3 is touching the bottom of the container.
> - **Student 4** is holding it vertically, immersed in water, without touching the sides or bottom. This is the correct method.

**Q7. Observe the part of thermometer shown in Fig. 7.8 and answer:**
*(Figure shows a scale with 10 divisions between 0 and 10, and 10 and 20. The liquid level is not explicitly defined in text but usually asks for least count or specific reading).*

(i) **What type of thermometer is it?**
It is likely a **Laboratory Thermometer** because the range shown includes 0 to 40°C with uniform divisions, typical for lab use.

(ii) **What is the reading of the thermometer?**
*Assumption based on typical textbook image:* If the red line is at the 2nd small mark after 20, the reading is $22^\circ C$.

(iii) **What is the smallest value that this thermometer can measure?**
-   Difference between big marks (0 to 10) = $10^\circ C$.
-   Number of divisions = 10.
-   Least Count = $10 / 10 = 1^\circ C$.

---

**Q8. A laboratory thermometer is not used to measure our body temperature. Give a reason.**
**Answer:** A laboratory thermometer does not have a "kink" or constriction near the bulb. Therefore, the mercury/alcohol level falls immediately as soon as it is taken out of the mouth (or contact with the body), making it impossible to get an accurate reading of body temperature.

---

**Q9. Vaishnavi's Temperature Record (Table 7.4 Analysis)**

(i) **Highest recorded temperature?**
**Answer:** $40.0^\circ C$ (Recorded on Day One at 7 pm).

(ii) **On which day and time?**
**Answer:** Day One at 7 pm.

(iii) **When did temperature return to normal?**
**Answer:** Normal body temp is approx $37.0^\circ C$. Looking at the table, on **Day Three at 4pm**, the temperature was $37.0^\circ C$.

---

**Q10. If you have to measure the temperature 22.5 °C, which thermometer will you use?**
*(Fig 7.9 shows three thermometers with different least counts)*
-   (a) Divisions of 1 degree ($0, 1, 2...$)
-   (b) Divisions of 0.5 degree ($0, 0.5, 1...$) - *Implied by 2 divisions per degree*
-   (c) Divisions of 2 degrees ($0, 2, 4...$)

**Answer:** You should use thermometer **(b)**.
> **Reason:** To measure $22.5^\circ C$ accurately, the thermometer must have a least count of at least $0.5^\circ C$. A thermometer with 1-degree markings can only read 22 or 23 reliably.

---

**Q11. The temperature shown by the thermometer in Fig. 7.10 is...**
(i) $28.0^\circ C$
(ii) $27.5^\circ C$
(iii) $26.5^\circ C$
(iv) $25.3^\circ C$

**Answer:** (iii) $26.5^\circ C$
> **Reason:** (Based on visual interpretation of standard textbook diagrams). If the mark is halfway between 26 and 27, it is 26.5. If the divisions are 0.5 degrees, this reading is possible.

---

**Q12. A laboratory thermometer has 50 divisions between 0°C and 100°C. What does each division measure?**
**Answer:**
-   Temperature difference = $100 - 0 = 100^\circ C$.
-   Total divisions = 50.
-   Value of 1 division = $\frac{100}{50} = 2^\circ C$.

---

**Q13. Draw scale between 10°C and 20°C with smallest division 0.5°C.**
*(Self-Practice Drawing)*: You would draw the mark 10 and 20. Between them, you would place 19 small lines to create 20 gaps (since $10 / 0.5 = 20$ divisions).

---

**Q14. Komal has a fever of 101 degrees. Is it Celsius or Fahrenheit?**
**Answer:** It is on the **Fahrenheit scale ($^\circ F$)**.
> **Reason:** $101^\circ C$ is above the boiling point of water. A human cannot survive at that temperature. In Fahrenheit, $101^\circ F$ indicates a moderate fever (normal is $98.6^\circ F$).
