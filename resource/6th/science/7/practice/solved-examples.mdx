## Topic: Calculating Least Count

**Example 1:**
A thermometer has markings at $0^\circ C$ and $5^\circ C$. There are 5 divisions between these two marks. What is the smallest temperature this thermometer can measure?

**Solution:**
1.  **Difference in temperature:** $5 - 0 = 5^\circ C$.
2.  **Number of divisions:** 5.
3.  **Least Count:** $\frac{5}{5} = 1^\circ C$.
    *Answer: The thermometer can measure a minimum change of $1^\circ C$.*

**Example 2:**
A thermometer has markings at $10^\circ C$ and $20^\circ C$. There are 20 divisions between these marks. What is the reading if the liquid is at the 3rd division after $15^\circ C$?

**Solution:**
1.  **Calculate Least Count:**
    -   Difference = $20 - 10 = 10^\circ C$.
    -   Divisions = 20.
    -   Least Count = $\frac{10}{20} = 0.5^\circ C$.
2.  **Read the Value:**
    -   Base mark = $15^\circ C$.
    -   Additional reading = 3 divisions $\times$ $0.5^\circ C$ = $1.5^\circ C$.
    -   Total Temperature = $15 + 1.5 = 16.5^\circ C$.

## Topic: Temperature Scales

**Example 3:**
The temperature of a liquid is $27^\circ C$. What is this temperature in the Kelvin scale?

**Solution:**
We know the formula:
$$
T_{(K)} = T_{(^\circ C)} + 273.15
$$
$$
T_{(K)} = 27 + 273.15
$$
$$
T_{(K)} = 300.15 K
$$
