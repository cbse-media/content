## Purpose
Used to measure the temperature of objects other than the human body (e.g., boiling water, ice, chemical reactions).

## Structure
-   A long, narrow, uniform glass tube.
-   A bulb at one end containing liquid (alcohol colored red, or mercury).
-   **Range:** Typically **-10°C to 110°C**.

## Finding the Least Count
To measure accurately, you must know the value of the smallest division (Least Count).

**Method:**
1.  Find the difference between two big marks (e.g., $10^\circ C$ and $20^\circ C$). Difference = $10^\circ C$.
2.  Count the number of divisions between them (e.g., 10 divisions).
3.  Calculate:
    $$
    \text{Smallest Division} = \frac{10}{10} = 1^\circ C
    $$

## Proper Usage Techniques (Activity 7.5)
Unlike a clinical thermometer, a laboratory thermometer generally does not have a "kink" to hold the mercury level. Therefore:

1.  **Keep it Vertical:** Do not tilt the thermometer.
2.  **Immersion:** The bulb must be fully immersed in the substance (e.g., water).
3.  **No Contact:** The bulb should **not touch** the bottom or sides of the container.
4.  **Read Inside:** Read the temperature **while the thermometer is still in the water**. If you take it out, the level falls immediately.

<Callout variant="warning">
**Crucial Difference:** You cannot use a laboratory thermometer to measure body temperature because the level drops as soon as you take it out of the mouth. Clinical thermometers have a special design (kink) or digital memory to hold the reading.
