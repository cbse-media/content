## Room and Weather Temperature

Thermometers hung on walls in homes or offices give the **room temperature**. However, strictly measuring the outside temperature helps in weather forecasting.

### Weather Reports
Newspapers and TV news report the **Maximum** and **Minimum** temperatures of the day.
-   These vary day by day.
-   Usually, it is hotter in summer and colder in winter.
