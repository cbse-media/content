## Purpose
A **Clinical Thermometer** is designed specifically to measure human body temperature.

## Types
1.  **Mercury Thermometer:** Traditional glass tube with mercury. Mercury is toxic and hard to dispose of if broken.
2.  **Digital Thermometer:** Modern, safe, uses heat sensors, and displays temperature on a digital screen. **Recommended for use.**

## Features
-   **Range:** Usually from **35°C to 42°C**.
    *   *Reason:* Human body temperature never goes below 35°C or above 42°C under normal/survivable conditions.
-   **Normal Temperature:** The average body temperature of a healthy person is **37.0°C** (or 98.6°F).

<Callout variant="info">
**Did you know?** The "normal" temperature is actually an average. A healthy person might have a temperature slightly higher or lower than 37.0°C.

## How to use a Digital Clinical Thermometer

1.  **Wash:** Clean the tip with soap and water before use.
2.  **Reset:** Press the reset/power button.
3.  **Place:** Put the tip under the tongue (or in the armpit for children/elderly).
4.  **Wait:** Wait for the beep sound.
5.  **Read:** Check the display.
6.  **Clean:** Wash the tip again after use.
