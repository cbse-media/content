# Temperature and its Measurement

## Introduction

In our daily lives, we often come across objects that are hot or cold. From boiling water to ice cream, the difference we feel is due to **heat**. However, our sense of touch is not always reliable. To measure exactly "how hot" or "how cold" an object is, we need a standard physical quantity called **Temperature**.

This chapter explores how we define temperature, the instruments used to measure it (thermometers), and the different scales used scientifically.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition | SI Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** | A reliable measure of the hotness or coldness of a body. | Kelvin (K) |
| **Thermometer** | A device used to measure temperature. | - |
| **Clinical Thermometer** | Used to measure human body temperature. Range: 35°C to 42°C. | - |
| **Laboratory Thermometer** | Used for science experiments. Range: -10°C to 110°C. | - |

## Formula Sheet

### 1. Temperature Conversion (Celsius to Kelvin)
The scientific scale (SI unit) is Kelvin. To convert Celsius ($^\circ C$) to Kelvin ($K$):

$$
T_{(K)} = T_{(^\circ C)} + 273.15
$$

### 2. Least Count of a Thermometer
The smallest value that can be read accurately on a thermometer.

$$
\text{Least Count} = \frac{\text{Difference between two bigger marks}}{\text{Number of divisions between them}}
$$

## Chapter Structure

The chapter is divided into the following detailed topics:

1.  **Hot or Cold**: Why our sense of touch fails.
2.  **What is Temperature**: Definitions and Scales.
3.  **Clinical Thermometer**: Measuring body temperature.
4.  **Laboratory Thermometer**: Measuring other objects and precautions.
5.  **Air Temperature**: Weather measurement.
