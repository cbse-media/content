## Question 1: The Seed Puzzle
**Scenario:** A seed in a packet does not move, eat, or breathe visibly. Is it alive?

**Solution:**
A seed is considered **alive but dormant**. It has an embryo inside that is resting. Its metabolic activities (respiration) are happening at a very, very slow rate, almost undetectable. Once favourable conditions (water, warmth, air) are provided, it "wakes up" and actively displays characteristics of life like growth and higher respiration.

## Question 2: The Moving Cloud
**Scenario:** A cloud moves across the sky and grows larger as it gathers more vapor. Why is it not a living being?

**Solution:**
1.  **Growth:** A cloud grows by **accumulation** of material from the outside (external growth). Living beings grow from the **inside** by cell division (internal growth).
2.  **Nutrition/Reproduction:** A cloud does not eat food or reproduce to create baby clouds in a biological sense.
3.  **Life Cycle:** It does not have a biological birth or death, it just changes state (evaporation/condensation).

## Question 3: Broken Stomata
**Scenario:** If we coat the leaves of a plant with thick wax or oil, what will happen to the plant?

**Solution:**
The plant will likely die.
*   **Reason 1 (Respiration):** The wax blocks the **stomata** (tiny pores). The plant cannot take in oxygen for respiration or release carbon dioxide.
*   **Reason 2 (Photosynthesis):** It cannot take in Carbon Dioxide needed to make food.
*   **Reason 3 (Transpiration):** It cannot release excess water.

## Question 4: Mosquito Control
**Scenario:** Why does the municipal corporation advise not to leave water in coolers or pots for many days?

**Solution:**
Stagnant water is the breeding ground for **mosquitoes**.
1.  Mosquitoes lay eggs in stagnant water.
2.  The eggs hatch into larvae and pupae which live in water.
3.  By removing water, we break the life cycle at the **Egg/Larva** stage, preventing the emergence of adult mosquitoes that spread diseases like Dengue and Malaria.
