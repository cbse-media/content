## Introduction

We are surrounded by a diverse world containing both **living beings** (like pigeons, plants, and humans) and **non-living things** (like pencils, cars, and books). But what exactly sets them apart? While a car moves, it isn't alive. While a tree doesn't walk, it is alive.

In this chapter, we explore the essential characteristics that define life, the conditions required for seeds to turn into plants, and the fascinating life cycles of various organisms.

## Key Concepts

The chapter focuses on three main pillars:

1.  **Characteristics of Life:** How to distinguish living form non-living based on specific biological processes (Respiration, Excretion, Reproduction, etc.).
2.  **Plant Growth:** From seed germination to the directional movement of roots and shoots.
3.  **Life Cycles:** The stages of development in plants (beans) and animals (mosquitoes, frogs).

## Formula & Definitions Sheet

<Callout variant="tip">
**Stimulus & Response:**
*   **Stimulus:** Any change in the environment (heat, light, sound) that prompts a reaction.
*   **Response:** The reaction of the living being to the stimulus.

$$
\text{Life Cycle} = \text{Birth/Germination} \rightarrow \text{Growth} \rightarrow \text{Reproduction} \rightarrow \text{Death}
$$

## Chapter Structure

The following topics are covered in detail:

*   **Living vs. Non-Living:** Defining the boundaries.
*   **Essential Characteristics:** Nutrition, Respiration, Excretion, Growth, and Movement.
*   **Seed Germination:** The role of water, air, and soil.
*   **Plant Movement:** How plants respond to light and gravity.
*   **Life Cycles:** A comparative study of plants, mosquitoes, and frogs.
