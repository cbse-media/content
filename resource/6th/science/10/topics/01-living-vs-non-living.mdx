## Distinguishing Features

We see many things around us—shells, snails, cars, and trees. Sometimes it can be confusing to categorize them. For example, a car moves and consumes fuel, but it is not alive. A cloud grows in size, but it is not alive.

To identify something as **living**, it generally must exhibit **all** of the following characteristics over its lifespan. If it lacks these intrinsic biological processes, it is considered non-living.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Living Beings (e.g., Pigeon, Plant) | Non-Living Things (e.g., Pencil, Car) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Growth** | Grows from within; irreversible. | Does not grow (or grows by accumulation, like a snowball). |
| **Nutrition** | Needs food/nutrients to survive. | Does not need food. |
| **Respiration** | Breathes/respires to release energy. | Does not respire. |
| **Reproduction**| Produces young ones of its own kind. | Cannot reproduce. |
| **Excretion** | Removes waste from the body. | Does not excrete. |
| **Response** | Responds to stimuli (light, touch). | No response to stimuli. |
| **Life Span** | Has a birth and death. | Exists until destroyed; no biological death. |

**The "Movement" Confusion:**
Movement alone is not a defining feature of life.
*   **Animals** move from place to place.
*   **Plants** do not move their whole body, but parts of them move (e.g., flowers opening, roots growing down).
*   **Cars/Clouds** move due to external forces or fuel combustion, but they do not grow, reproduce, or respire.

### The Case of the Shell
In the introduction, Avadhi finds a shell. A shell itself is non-living (it's a hard protective layer), but it was once part of a living snail. Once separated or if the snail dies, the shell remains as a non-living object.
