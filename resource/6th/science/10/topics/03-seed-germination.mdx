## What is Germination?
Germination is the process by which a seed turns into a sprout (seedling).

## Activity 10.2: The 4-Pot Experiment
To understand what seeds need, we set up an experiment with 4 pots containing bean seeds.

### Setup
*   **Pot A:** Direct sunlight, **No water**.
*   **Pot B:** Direct sunlight, **Excess water** (submerged).
*   **Pot C:** Dark room, **Moist soil** (moderate water).
*   **Pot D:** Direct sunlight, **Moist soil** (moderate water).

### Observations (After 7-10 days)

| Pot | Conditions | Result | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | Air + Light (No Water) | No Germination | **Water** is missing. Water softens the seed coat for the embryo. |
| **B** | Light + Water (No Air) | Rotting/No Germination | **Air** is missing. Roots/seeds need oxygen from soil spaces. |
| **C** | Water + Air (No Light) | **Germination** | Light is not essential for the *initial* germination of bean seeds. |
| **D** | Water + Air + Light | **Germination** | All conditions are optimal. |

### Conclusion: Essential Conditions
From the experiment, we observe that the essential conditions for seed germination are:
1.  **Water:** To soften the seed coat and activate growth.
2.  **Air (Oxygen):** For respiration of the growing embryo.
3.  **Correct Temperature:** (Implied by the environment).

**Is Light Needed?**
For most seeds (like beans), light is **not** required for germination (sprouting). They can germinate in the dark (Pot C). However, **after** germination, sunlight is required for the seedling to grow healthy and green (photosynthesis). *Note: Some specific seeds like Petunia do require light to germinate.*
