## 1. Nutrition and Growth
All living beings need food (nutrition) for growth and development.
*   **Animals:** Eat plants or other animals.
*   **Plants:** Make their own food via photosynthesis (using sunlight, water, air).
*   **Growth:** You cannot wear your clothes from 4 years ago because you have grown. Plants grow from seeds into trees. Non-living things do not show internal growth.

## 2. Respiration
Respiration is the process of releasing energy from food. **Breathing** is just a part of respiration (inhaling air and exhaling).

*   **Animals:** We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Chest movement indicates breathing.
*   **Plants:** Plants also respire day and night. They take in air through tiny pores on leaves called **stomata**.

**Did You Know?**
While plants produce oxygen during the day (photosynthesis), they consume oxygen for respiration continuously (day and night).

## 3. Excretion
The removal of waste products formed in the body is called **excretion**.
*   **Animals:** Excrete wastes like urine, sweat, and feces. Sweat also helps cool the body.
*   **Plants:** Excrete excess water through leaves (transpiration) and sometimes store wastes in parts like bark or leaves that eventually fall off.

## 4. Response to Stimuli
A **stimulus** is any change in the surroundings (heat, sharp object, light). The reaction to it is the **response**.
*   **Example:** Stepping on a thorn (stimulus) makes you pull your foot away (response).
*   **Plants:**
    *   The **Touch-me-not** (*Mimosa pudica*) folds its leaves when touched.
    *   Sunflowers turn towards the sun.
    *   Roots grow towards gravity/water.

## 5. Reproduction
Reproduction is producing new individuals of one's own kind. It ensures the continuity of life.
*   **Animals:** Some lay eggs (birds, snakes, mosquitoes), others give birth to young ones (humans, cats, cows).
*   **Plants:** Mostly reproduce through seeds, but some reproduce through stems (rose) or leaves (bryophyllum).

## 6. Movement
Living things show movement.
*   **Animals:** Locomotion (moving from place to place).
*   **Plants:** Anchored to soil, but show movements like:
    *   Opening/closing of flowers.
    *   Insectivorous plants (e.g., *Drosera*) closing traps on insects.
    *   Climbers winding around support.

## 7. Death
Eventually, all living beings die. If an object shows none of these signs, or stops showing them permanently, it is non-living or dead.
