## Let Us Enhance Our Learning

### 1. List the similarities and differences in life cycles of plants and animals.

**Answer:**
*   **Similarities:**
    *   Both start life (seed/egg/birth).
    *   Both involve growth and development.
    *   Both reach maturity and reproduce.
    *   Both eventually die.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Mobility:** Animals often move during their life cycle stages (e.g., tadpole swimming), while plants remain anchored (though they grow).
    *   **Form Change:** Many animals (like frogs/butterflies) undergo **metamorphosis** (drastic shape change). Plants generally maintain the same structural plan (root/shoot) just increasing in size and complexity (adding flowers/fruit).
    *   **Seed vs Egg:** Plants typically grow from seeds which can remain dormant for long periods; animals grow from eggs or birth and usually develop continuously.

### 2. Analysis of Table Data (Growth and Respiration)

**Scenario:** Analyze objects based on "Does it grow?" and "Does it respire?".

| Case | Grows? | Respires? | Example | Reason/Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | No | No | **Stone / Chair** | Non-living things do neither. |
| **2** | No | Yes | **Not Possible** | Respiration produces energy *for* life processes like growth and maintenance. A thing cannot respire without being alive, and if it is alive, it usually shows some form of growth or repair. |
| **3** | Yes | No | **Cloud / Crystal** | Clouds "grow" by accumulation of water vapor, but they do not respire. This is non-biological growth. |
| **4** | Yes | Yes | **Tree / Child** | Typical characteristics of living beings. |

### 3. Proper storage of grains and pulses.
**Question:** You have learnt that different conditions are required for seed germination. How can we use this knowledge for proper storage of grains and pulses?

**Answer:**
Seeds germinate when they have **water (moisture)**, **air**, and suitable **temperature**. To store grains (which are seeds) without them sprouting or rotting:
*   **Keep them dry:** Remove moisture to prevent germination and fungal growth.
*   **Airtight containers:** Limit exposure to moisture in the air.
*   **Cool place:** High temperatures can encourage spoilage or pests, though some warmth is needed for germination, keeping them cool preserves dormancy.
*   **Key Strategy:** The most critical factor to control is **moisture**. Dry seeds remain dormant.

### 4. Advantage of a tail in the tadpole stage.
**Question:** What is the advantage of having a tail in the tadpole stage?

**Answer:**
Tadpoles live strictly in **water**. The tail serves as a swimming organ (fin-like structure). It helps the tadpole propel itself through water to find food and escape predators. As it metamorphoses into a frog and moves to land, the tail is reabsorbed, and legs develop for jumping.

### 5. Wooden Log: Living or Non-living?
**Question:** Charan says a wooden log is non-living (cannot move). Charu says it is living (made of wood from trees). Give arguments.

**Answer:**
*   **Charan is correct that it is Non-living.**
*   **Reasoning:** While wood was *once* part of a living tree, a cut wooden log no longer carries out life processes. It does not respire, excrete, eat, or grow. It is dead organic matter. Therefore, it is classified as **non-living** (or dead).

### 6. Similarities and differences in life cycles of a mosquito and a frog.

**Answer:**
*   **Similarities:**
    *   Both lay eggs in **water**.
    *   Both undergo **metamorphosis** (distinct larval stages different from adult).
    *   The young ones (larva/tadpole) are aquatic and breathe dissolved oxygen.
    *   Adults can live in air (aerial/terrestrial).
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Stages:** Mosquito has 4 stages (Egg -> Larva -> Pupa -> Adult). Frog generally described in 3 main phases (Egg -> Tadpole -> Adult) though detailed as multiple steps.
    *   **Pupa:** Mosquito has a pupal stage (inactive feeder); Frogs do not have a pupal stage.
    *   **Adult Habitat:** Adult mosquitoes fly (aerial); Adult frogs are amphibious (land/water) and hop.

### 7. Plant Prediction (Fig 10.9)
**Question:** A plant is placed horizontally. What happens after one week?

**Answer:**
*   **Shoot:** Will bend and grow **upwards** (away from gravity, towards light).
*   **Root:** Will bend and grow **downwards** (towards gravity).
*   **Reason:** This is due to **geotropism**. Roots are positively geotropic (go down), and shoots are negatively geotropic (go up).

### 8. Tara and Vijay's Experiment (Fig 10.10)
**Question:** What do they want to find out? (Image shows a seedling in a box with a hole).

**Answer:**
*   **Aim:** To demonstrate **Phototropism** (plant movement in response to light).
*   **Setup:** The plant is in a dark box with light entering from only one hole.
*   **Observation:** The shoot will bend towards the hole.
*   **Conclusion:** Plants grow towards the source of light.

### 9. Experiment Design: Temperature and Germination.
**Question:** Design an experiment to check if temperature has an effect on seed germination.

**Answer:**
1.  **Take two sets** of identical bean seeds (e.g., 10 in each).
2.  **Control Variables:** Provide both sets with equal moisture (wet cotton) and air.
3.  **Variable:**
    *   **Set A:** Place inside a **refrigerator** (Very low temperature).
    *   **Set B:** Place in a **room** at normal temperature (25°C - 30°C).
4.  **Observation:** Observe after 5 days.
5.  **Expected Result:** Seeds in the room (Set B) will germinate. Seeds in the fridge (Set A) will likely not germinate or be very slow.
6.  **Conclusion:** Suitable temperature (warmth) is necessary for germination.
