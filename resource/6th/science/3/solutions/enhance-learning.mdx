## Question 2: Discuss traditional versus modern culinary practices in India.
**Answer:**
*   **Traditional Practices:** In the past, cooking was done on **Chulhas** using wood or coal. Grinding was done manually on a **Sil-batta** (stone grinder). Food was often cooked in clay pots which retained nutrients but took longer.
*   **Modern Practices:** Today, we use **Gas stoves (LPG)** or induction cooktops which are cleaner and faster. We use **electrical mixers/grinders** which save time and effort. While modern methods are convenient, over-cooking or using excess refined oils can reduce nutritional value.

## Question 4: Thoughts on delicious vs. healthy food.
**Answer:**
It is true that taste does not always equal health.

*   **Conclusion:** We should train our taste buds to enjoy healthy foods by cooking them in tasty ways.
