## Question 9: Sugar is a carbohydrate but does not turn blue-black with Iodine. Why?
**Answer:**
The Iodine test is specific for **Starch**, which is a complex carbohydrate. Iodine molecules get trapped in the helical structure of starch, creating a blue-black colour. **Sugar (Glucose/Sucrose)** is a simple carbohydrate with a different structure that does not trap iodine. Therefore, it does not change colour.

## Question 10: "All starches are carbohydrates but not all carbohydrates are starches."
**Answer:**
*   **Explanation:** Carbohydrates is the main category. It includes sugars (simple carbs), starch (complex carbs), and cellulose (fibre). So, starch is just one *type* of carbohydrate. Sugar is another type.
*   **Activity Design:**
    1.  Take two samples: Potato juice (Starch) and Sugar solution (Sugar).
    2.  Add Iodine solution to both.
    3.  **Observation:** Potato turns blue-black (Starch present). Sugar solution does not.
    4.  **Conclusion:** Both provide energy (are carbs), but only one tests positive for starch.

## Question 11: Iodine on socks vs. Saree.
**Answer:**
*   **Reason:** The teacher's saree was likely **starched** (stiffened using starch water, a common practice for cotton sarees). The iodine reacted with the starch on the saree to turn blue-black.
*   Mishti's socks were likely made of synthetic material or cotton that was not starched, so there was no starch for the iodine to react with.

## Question 12: Why are millets healthy? Can we eat *only* millets?
**Answer:**
*   **Why Healthy:** Millets (Jowar, Bajra, Ragi) are rich in dietary fibre, minerals (Iron, Calcium), and vitamins. They digest slowly, providing steady energy.
*   **Can we eat only millets?** No single food can provide *all* nutrients in the exact amounts needed. While millets are excellent sources of carbs and minerals, we still need other sources for sufficient proteins (pulses/dairy) and healthy fats. A **balanced diet** requires variety.

## Question 13: How to check if a solution is Iodine?
**Answer:**
To confirm if an unknown solution is Iodine:
1.  Take a food item known to contain starch (e.g., a slice of raw potato or boiled rice).
2.  Add a few drops of the unknown solution to it.
3.  If the food item turns **Blue-Black**, the solution is Iodine.
