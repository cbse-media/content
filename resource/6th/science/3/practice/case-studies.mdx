## Case Study 1: The Sailors & Scurvy

**Scenario:** In 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed sailors suffering from bleeding gums and swollen limbs during long sea voyages.

**Analysis:**
*   **Problem:** Sailors ate preserved food (dry biscuits, salted meat) for months with no fresh produce.
*   **Observation:** Those who ate lemons and oranges recovered.
*   **Scientific Conclusion:** The sailors lacked **Vitamin C**, which is found in citrus fruits. The deficiency disease is called **Scurvy**. Vitamin C is crucial for healthy gums and wound healing.

## Case Study 2: Goitre in the Himalayas

**Scenario:** In the 1960s, people in the Northern plains and Himalayas had swollen necks.

**Analysis:**
*   **Problem:** The soil in these regions was deficient in **Iodine**, so the crops and water also lacked Iodine.
*   **Symptom:** Swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck.
*   **Solution:** The Government introduced **Iodised Salt** (Salt mixed with Potassium Iodate).
*   **Scientific Conclusion:** Iodine is essential for the production of thyroxine hormone. Its deficiency causes **Goitre**.
