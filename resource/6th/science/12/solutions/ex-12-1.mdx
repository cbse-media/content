## 9. Stars at Dawn/Dusk

**You can see stars fading away at dawn and appearing at dusk. During the day we do not see the stars. Explain why.**

**Answer:** Stars are present in the sky during the day, but we cannot see them because of the glare of the Sun. The Sun is very close to Earth, making its light extremely bright. This intense sunlight scatters in the Earth's atmosphere, turning the sky blue and outshining the faint light of distant stars.

## 10. Movement of Big Dipper

**Does the Big Dipper appear to move?**

**Answer:** Yes, the Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star.
*   **Observation:** If you observe it at intervals of 2-3 hours, you will see the constellation rotating counter-clockwise around the North Star.
*   **Reason:** This apparent movement is due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis. Since the North Pole points to the Pole Star, that star appears stationary, while everything else appears to circle it.
