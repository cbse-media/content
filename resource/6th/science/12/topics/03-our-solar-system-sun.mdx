## What is the Solar System?

The **Solar System** consists of the Sun and all the objects that orbit (move around) it due to its gravity. This includes:
*   The Sun (our star).
*   Eight Planets.
*   Dwarf planets (like Pluto).
*   Satellites (Moons).
*   Asteroids, Comets, and Meteoroids.

## The Sun

The Sun is the center of our Solar System.
*   **Type:** It is a **star**.
*   **Composition:** An extremely hot, spherical ball of gases (mostly hydrogen and helium).
*   **Significance:** It is the ultimate source of heat and light for the Solar System. Without the Sun, life on Earth would not exist.
*   **Size:** It is huge—about **100 times wider** than Earth in diameter.
*   **Distance:** It is about **150 million kilometers** away from Earth.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Astronomical Unit (au):** The average distance between the Sun and the Earth (approx. 150 million km) is defined as 1 Astronomical Unit. It is used to measure distances within the solar system.

### Why does the Sun look so big?
The Sun looks like a large disk, while other stars look like pinpoints. This is because the Sun is much closer to us than any other star. The next nearest star, **Proxima Centauri**, is about 269,000 au away!

### Revolution and Rotation
*   **Revolution:** The movement of an object *around* the Sun. Earth takes ~365 days to complete one revolution.
*   **Rotation:** The spinning of an object on its own axis. Earth takes 24 hours to complete one rotation (causing Day and Night).
