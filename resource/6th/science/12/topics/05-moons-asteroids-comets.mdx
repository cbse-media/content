## Natural Satellites (Moons)
A **satellite** is any object that orbits a planet.
*   **Natural Satellites:** Celestial bodies orbiting planets (e.g., the Moon).
*   **Artificial Satellites:** Man-made machines sent into space (e.g., for communication).

### The Earth's Moon
*   **Distance:** Approx 3,84,000 km.
*   **Revolution Period:** ~27 days.
*   **Surface:** Dusty and barren with many **craters** (bowl-like depressions formed by space rocks hitting the surface).
*   **Atmosphere:** No air or water, so no life exists there.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Exploration:** India has sent successful missions to the Moon, including **Chandrayaan-3**, which landed near the Moon's South Pole in 2023.

## Asteroids
Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. They are too small to be called planets.
*   **Asteroid Belt:** Most asteroids are found in a belt between the orbits of **Mars** and **Jupiter**.

## Comets
Comets are lumps of ice, dust, and rock.
*   **Structure:** When a comet comes close to the Sun, the heat causes the ice to vaporize, creating a glowing head and a long tail that points *away* from the Sun.
*   **Orbits:** They have very long, elliptical orbits.
*   **Example:** **Halley's Comet**, which is visible from Earth approximately every 76 years.

## Dwarf Planets
Some objects orbit the Sun but are not large enough to clear their path of other debris. These are called **Dwarf Planets**.
*   **Pluto:** Once considered the 9th planet, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the IAU in 2006.
