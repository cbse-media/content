## Example 1: Identifying Plant Types

**Problem:** You are given three plants: Tomato, Lemon, and Neem. Classify them into Herb, Shrub, and Tree and give one reason for each.

**Solution:**
1.  **Tomato:**
    *   *Classification:* **Herb**.
    *   *Reason:* It has a soft, green, and tender stem.
2.  **Lemon:**
    *   *Classification:* **Shrub**.
    *   *Reason:* It has a hard stem that branches out near the base (close to the ground).
3.  **Neem:**
    *   *Classification:* **Tree**.
    *   *Reason:* It has a thick, hard, brown trunk and branches appear high up from the ground.

## Example 2: Adaptation Match

**Problem:** Match the organism with its adaptive feature and function.

| Organism | Feature | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Fish | A. Spines | i. Prevent water loss |
| 2. Cactus | B. Thick Fur | ii. Swim in water |
| 3. Yak | C. Fins | iii. Protect from cold |

**Solution:**
1.  **Fish** $\rightarrow$ **C. Fins** $\rightarrow$ **ii. Swim in water**.
2.  **Cactus** $\rightarrow$ **A. Spines** $\rightarrow$ **i. Prevent water loss**.
3.  **Yak** $\rightarrow$ **B. Thick Fur** $\rightarrow$ **iii. Protect from cold**.

## Example 3: Logical Reasoning

**Problem:** A plant has leaves with parallel venation. What kind of roots does it likely have? Can you name two seeds that would produce such a plant?

**Step-by-Step Logic:**
1.  **Identify Rule:** Parallel Venation $\leftrightarrow$ Fibrous Roots $\leftrightarrow$ Monocot Seeds.
2.  **Determine Roots:** Since venation is parallel, the roots are **Fibrous Roots**.
3.  **Determine Seeds:** The seeds must be **Monocots**.
4.  **Examples:** Maize, Wheat, Rice.

## Example 4: Habitat Analysis

**Problem:** Why can't a lotus plant survive in a desert, and why can't a cactus survive in a pond?

**Solution:**
*   **Lotus in Desert:** A lotus is adapted for **aquatic life**. It has a weak stem (supported by water) and stomata on the upper surface of leaves. In a desert, it would dry out immediately because it cannot store water or prevent water loss like a cactus.
*   **Cactus in Pond:** A cactus is adapted for **desert life**. Its roots need air (aerated soil). If placed in a pond, the roots would rot due to excess water, and the plant would die.
