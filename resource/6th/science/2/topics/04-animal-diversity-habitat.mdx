## Grouping by Movement

Animals move in various ways to find food, shelter, or escape enemies. The body parts they use depend on their method of movement.

| Animal | Mode of Movement | Body Part Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Human/Cow** | Walk, Run | Legs |
| **Bird (Pigeon)** | Fly, Walk | Wings, Legs |
| **Fish** | Swim | Fins, Tail, Streamlined Body |
| **Snake** | Slither/Crawl | Whole body (muscles/scales) |
| **Insect (Ant)** | Crawl/Walk | Legs |
| **Frog** | Jump, Swim | Strong hind legs, Webbed feet |

## Grouping by Habitat

The place where an organism lives is called its **Habitat**. The habitat provides food, water, air, and shelter.

### 1. Terrestrial Habitat (Land)
Animals that live on land.
*   **Deserts:** Hot and dry. (e.g., Camel, Rattlesnake).
*   **Mountains:** Cold and windy. (e.g., Yak, Mountain Goat, Snow Leopard).
*   **Forests/Grasslands:** Moderate climate. (e.g., Lion, Deer).

### 2. Aquatic Habitat (Water)
Animals that live in water.
*   **Oceans (Marine):** Salty water. (e.g., Whale, Shark, Octopus).
*   **Freshwater:** Ponds, lakes, rivers. (e.g., Rohu fish, Lotus).

### 3. Amphibians
Animals that can live **both** on land and in water.
*   *Examples:* Frog, Toad, Salamander.
