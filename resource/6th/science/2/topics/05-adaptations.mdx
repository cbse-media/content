## What is Adaptation?

**Adaptations** are special features or habits that help an organism survive in its specific habitat. These changes happen over a very long period.

### 1. Adaptation in Deserts (Hot & Dry)

**The Camel:**
*   **Long legs:** Keep the body away from the hot sand.
*   **Hump:** Stores food (fat) to survive when food is scarce.
*   **Broad hooves:** Prevent sinking into loose sand.
*   **Physiology:** Excretes dry dung, very little urine, and does not sweat to save water.

**Desert Plants (Cactus):**
*   **Leaves:** Reduced to **spines** to prevent water loss.
*   **Stem:** Green and fleshy to perform photosynthesis and store water.
*   **Roots:** Go very deep to find water.

### 2. Adaptation in Mountains (Cold & Windy)

**Mountain Trees (Deodar, Pine):**
*   **Shape:** Conical (cone-shaped).
*   **Branches:** Sloping, so snow slides off easily.
*   **Leaves:** Needle-like to reduce water loss and withstand wind.

**Mountain Animals (Snow Leopard, Yak, Goat):**
*   **Thick fur/skin:** Protects from extreme cold.
*   **Strong hooves:** Help in running up rocky slopes (Mountain Goat).

### 3. Adaptation in Water (Aquatic)

**Fish:**
*   **Streamlined body:** Shape tapers at both ends (like a boat) to cut through water easily.
*   **Fins & Tail:** Help in balance and changing direction.
*   **Gills:** To breathe oxygen dissolved in water.
*   **Scales:** Slippery scales protect the body.

## Biodiversity Conservation

Human activities like cutting forests and polluting water destroy habitats. This leads to a loss of biodiversity.

*   **Sacred Groves:** Traditionally protected forest patches in India (e.g., in Western Ghats) where no cutting or hunting is allowed.
*   **Project Tiger (1973):** Launched by the Govt. of India to protect the Bengal Tiger.
*   **Cheetah Reintroduction (2022):** Bringing Cheetahs back to India.

**Save Nature:** We must protect habitats to ensure plants and animals do not become extinct like the Dodo.
