## Areas of Exploration

In this book, we will limit our questions mostly to our home, **Planet Earth**, though we can always look up at the stars. As we discover more, we will realize that all these ideas are connected.

### 1. Life on Earth
Earth is the only planet we know that supports life. We will explore:
*   The amazing variety of plants and animals.
*   How seeds grow into plants.
*   How caterpillars transform into butterflies.

### 2. Food
We need food to grow and survive. India has a diverse cuisine. We will explore:
*   What are tasty dishes made of?
*   How do we find out their ingredients?

### 3. Water
Water is essential for survival.
*   Why and how does it rain?
*   Why does water become ice (solid) or steam (gas)?

### 4. Materials Around Us
Look at your pencil box. You have a metal key, a plastic ruler, a rubber eraser.
*   What are they made of?
*   How do we separate different materials?

**Note:** We will encounter interesting ideas and do thought-provoking experiments. Remember, the world is full of things we do not know, waiting to be explored!
