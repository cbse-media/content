## The Spirit of Inquiry

Science begins with **Curiosity**. Have you ever looked at the night sky and wondered why stars shine? or watched a flower bloom and wondered how it knows when to open? These questions are the foundation of science.

Science helps us unravel mysteries, whether they are in the depths of the ocean or the vastness of outer space.

### Science as a Jigsaw Puzzle

Imagine Science as a giant, unending **jigsaw puzzle**.

*   Every new discovery we make adds another piece to that puzzle.
*   **No Limit:** There is no limit to what we can discover. Every new piece of knowledge leads to more questions.
*   **Changing Knowledge:** Sometimes, we find that a piece of the puzzle has been put in the wrong place and needs to be moved. This means new discoveries can change our understanding of the world.

**Insight:** Groundbreaking discoveries often come from unexpected places—from what is cooking in the kitchen to what is happening on the playground.

### The "Whys" Person

To be good at science, you don't just need to memorize facts. You need to be a "Whys" person. You must constantly ask:
*   *Why is this happening?*
*   *How does this work?*

Science is rarely done alone. Scientists work in teams to solve these puzzles together!
