## Activity 1.1

**Question:**
Write about a problem similar to the "Pen Example" that you tried to solve. What steps did you take?

### Solution

*Note: This is a sample response. You can write about your own experience.*

**Problem:** The TV remote control stopped working while I was changing channels.

**Steps followed:**

1.  **Observation:** I pressed the buttons, but the TV did not respond.
2.  **Question:** Why is the remote not working?
3.  **Guess 1:** Maybe the batteries are dead.
4.  **Test 1:** I took out the old batteries and put in new ones.
5.  **Result:** It still did not work. My first guess was wrong.
6.  **Guess 2:** Maybe the batteries are inserted in the wrong direction.
7.  **Test 2:** I opened the cover and checked the `+` and `-` signs. I realized one battery was upside down. I corrected it.
8.  **Conclusion:** The remote started working! The problem was the orientation of the batteries.

**Analysis:** By testing one guess at a time, we found the real cause of the problem without buying a new remote unnecessarily.
