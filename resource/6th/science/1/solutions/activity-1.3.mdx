## Activity 1.3

**Question:**
1. If you have to ask "Why?" about something, what would you ask about?
2. Try to write down how you would attempt to find an answer to your question.

### Solution

*Note: There are infinite correct answers. Here is one example.*

**My Question:**
*Why do the leaves of some plants turn yellow?*

**My Plan to Find the Answer:**

1.  **Observation:** I have two identical potted plants. One is green, the other is turning yellow.
2.  **Guess (Hypothesis):** Maybe the yellow one is not getting enough water.
3.  **Experiment:**
    *   I will water the yellow plant regularly for 3 days.
    *   I will observe if it turns green again.
4.  **Alternative Guess:** If water doesn't help, maybe it needs sunlight.
    *   I will move the plant to a sunnier spot and observe for another week.
5.  **Research:** If neither works, I will ask a gardener or look up "Causes of yellow leaves" in a library book or internet.

**Collaboration:** The book suggests that if you cannot find the answer yourself, ask your friends! Science is often done in teams.
