## Activity 1.2

**Question:**
Describe a daily life situation where you think someone was following a scientific method.

### Solution

**Situation: The Bicycle Mechanic**

**Context:** I went to a cycle repair shop because my bicycle tyre was flat.

**Scientific Method Applied:**

1.  **Observation:** The mechanic saw the tyre was flat.
2.  **Question:** Where is the hole (puncture) in the tube?
3.  **Guess:** There is a leak somewhere, but it's too small to see with eyes.
4.  **Test:** The mechanic took the tube out, filled it with air, and immersed it in a tub of water.
5.  **Analysis:** He looked for air bubbles rising in the water.
6.  **Conclusion:** The spot where bubbles came out was the puncture point. He then fixed it at that exact spot.

<Callout variant="tip">
This method of testing (using water to find air leaks) is a classic scientific experiment used by mechanics every day!
