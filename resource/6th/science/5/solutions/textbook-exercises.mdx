## Q1. Match the lengths with suitable units

**Column I (Length)** vs **Column II (Unit)**

| Column I | Answer (Column II) | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Distance between Delhi and Lucknow | **kilometre** | Large distance between cities. |
| Thickness of a coin | **millimetre** | Very small length. |
| Length of an eraser | **centimetre** | Small object measuring a few cm. |
| Length of school ground | **metre** | Medium large area, best measured in metres. |

## Q2. True or False

(i) The motion of a car moving on a straight road is an example of linear motion.
**Answer: True**

(ii) Any object which is changing its position with respect to a reference point with time is said to be in motion.
**Answer: True**

(iii) 1 km = 100 cm.
**Answer: False**
*Correction:* $1 \text{ km} = 1000 \text{ m}$ and $1 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ cm}$. So, $1 \text{ km} = 100,000 \text{ cm}$.

## Q3. Which is NOT a standard unit of measuring length?
(i) millimetre
(ii) centimetre
(iii) kilometre
(iv) handspan

**Answer: (iv) handspan**
*Reason:* Handspan is a non-standard unit because it varies from person to person.

## Q4. Smallest value on different scales
*This is an activity-based question. Typical results:*
*   **15cm Plastic Scale:** The smallest division is usually **1 mm** (0.1 cm).
*   **Tailor's Tape:** Often marked in inches or cm. Smallest division is usually **1 mm** or 1/8 inch.

## Q5. Conversion Problem
**Suppose the distance between your school and home is 1.5 km. Express it in metres.**

**Solution:**
We know that:
$$ 1 \text{ km} = 1000 \text{ metres} $$

Given distance = $1.5 \text{ km}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Distance in metres} &= 1.5 \times 1000 \\
&= 1500 \text{ metres}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Answer:** 1500 m.

## Q6 - Q8. Practical Activities
*   **Q6 (Curved base):** Use a thread to wrap around the base, then measure the thread length on a scale.
*   **Q7 (Height):** Use a measuring tape.
    *   Example: Height = 150 cm.
    *   In metres: 1.50 m.
    *   In mm: 1500 mm.
*   **Q8 (Coin Estimate):**
    *   *Step 1:* Place coins edge-to-edge along the notebook side. Count them (e.g., 10 coins).
    *   *Step 2:* Measure notebook side with scale (e.g., 20 cm).
    *   *Step 3:* Measure coin diameter (e.g., 2 cm).
    *   *Verification:* $10 \text{ coins} \times 2 \text{ cm/coin} = 20 \text{ cm}$. Matches!

## Q9. Examples of Motion

1.  **Linear Motion:**
    *   An apple falling from a tree.
    *   A striker hitting a coin on a carrom board.
2.  **Circular Motion:**
    *   Tip of the second hand of a clock.
    *   A cyclist moving on a circular track.
3.  **Oscillatory Motion:**
    *   Motion of a needle in a sewing machine.
    *   Motion of a cradle.

## Q10. Sizes of Objects (Table 5.6)
*   **mm:** Thickness of ID card, tip of pen, ant.
*   **cm:** Pencil box, water bottle, mobile phone.
*   **m:** Length of classroom, height of a door, saree length.

---

## Q11. Rollercoaster Track Analysis
*Refer to Fig 5.19 in textbook.*

*   **Section A to B (Straight down):** **Linear Motion** (mostly straight path downwards).
*   **Loop (C to D to E):** **Circular Motion** (The ball travels in a circle/loop).
*   **Exit (E to F):** **Linear Motion** (Moving straight out).

## Q12. Tasneem's Scale Material
**Question:** Tasneem wants to make a metre scale. Materials considered: plywood, paper, cloth, stretchable rubber, steel. Which should she NOT use?

**Answer:** She should **not** use **stretchable rubber** (and arguably cloth if it stretches).

**Reason:** A standard measuring device must have a **fixed length**. Stretchable rubber changes its length when pulled, so the markings (cm/mm) would expand, giving inaccurate measurements. Plywood and steel are rigid and good for scales.

## Q13. Card Game
*Activity for students to design cards matching units (e.g., Card A: "1000 m", Card B: "1 km").*
