## The Confusion of Body Parts

Imagine trying to buy cloth for a uniform. If you ask for "two arm-lengths" of cloth, whose arm should be used? Yours? The shopkeeper's?

In ancient times, people used body parts for measurement:
*   **Handspan (Balisht):** The distance between the tip of the thumb and the little finger when stretched.
*   **Cubit:** Length from the elbow to the fingertips.
*   **Angula:** The width of a finger.
*   **Fist:** The width of a closed palm.
*   **Pace/Stride:** The length of a step.

### Why did this fail?
As Deepa and her friends discovered in the classroom activity, everyone's body parts are of different sizes. A table might be **13 handspans** long for one student but **14 handspans** long for another.

**Problem:** Measurements using body parts differ from person to person. This causes confusion in trade, construction, and daily life. Thus, there is a need for a **Standard Unit** that remains the same for everyone.

## Historical Context: India

India has a rich history of measurement. Ancient texts mention units like:
*   **Angula:** Finger width.
*   **Dhanusa:** A bow length.
*   **Yojana:** A long distance measure.

Excavations from the **Harappan Civilisation** have revealed objects with ruled markings, suggesting they used precise scales thousands of years ago!

## What is a Unit?

Measurement consists of two parts:
1.  **A Number:** The quantity (e.g., 5, 10, 100).
2.  **A Unit:** The fixed quantity used as a standard (e.g., metre, foot).

$$
\text{Measurement} = \text{Number} \times \text{Unit}
$$

*Example: If a table is 2 metres long, '2' is the number and 'metre' is the unit.*
