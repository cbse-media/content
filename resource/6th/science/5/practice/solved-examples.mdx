## Unit Conversion Practice

### Example 1: Converting Large Units
**Question:** The height of a building is 3250 cm. Express this height in metres.

**Solution:**
We know that:
$$ 100 \text{ cm} = 1 \text{ m} $$
So, to convert cm to m, we divide by 100.

$$
\text{Height} = \frac{3250}{100} \text{ m}
$$
$$
\text{Height} = 32.5 \text{ m}
$$

### Example 2: Converting to Small Units
**Question:** A pencil is 0.12 m long. What is its length in mm?

**Solution:**
First, convert metres to centimetres:
$$ 0.12 \text{ m} \times 100 = 12 \text{ cm} $$

Next, convert centimetres to millimetres:
$$ 1 \text{ cm} = 10 \text{ mm} $$
$$ 12 \text{ cm} \times 10 = 120 \text{ mm} $$

**Answer:** 120 mm.

## Identifying Motion Types

### Example 3: Mixed Motion
**Question:** A bicycle is moving on a straight road. What types of motion are exhibited by the bicycle?

**Solution:**
There are multiple types of motion happening simultaneously:
1.  **Linear Motion:** The bicycle as a whole is moving forward in a straight line.
2.  **Circular Motion:** The wheels and the pedals are rotating in circles around their axles.

### Example 4: The Sewing Machine
**Question:** Observe a sewing machine in use. Identify the motions.

**Solution:**
1.  **Wheel:** Undergoes **Circular Motion**.
2.  **Needle:** Undergoes **Oscillatory (Periodic) Motion** as it moves up and down rapidly.

## Critical Thinking

### Example 5: Broken Scale
**Question:** You have a ruler where the tip is broken. You start measuring an eraser from the mark $3.0 \text{ cm}$ and the eraser ends at the mark $7.6 \text{ cm}$. What is the length of the eraser?

**Solution:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Start Reading} &= 3.0 \text{ cm} \\
\text{End Reading} &= 7.6 \text{ cm} \\
\text{Length} &= \text{End} - \text{Start} \\
&= 7.6 - 3.0 \\
&= 4.6 \text{ cm}
\end{aligned}
$$
