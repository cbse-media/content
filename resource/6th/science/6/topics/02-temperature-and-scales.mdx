## What is Temperature?

A reliable measure of the hotness (or coldness) of a body is its **temperature**.
*   A hotter body has a higher temperature.
*   A colder body has a lower temperature.
*   The device used to measure temperature is called a **thermometer**.

## Temperature Scales

There are three common scales used to measure temperature.

### 1. Celsius Scale ($^{\circ}\text{C}$)
*   Unit: **degree Celsius**.
*   Most commonly used scale for clinical and laboratory work.
*   Water freezes at $0^{\circ}\text{C}$ and boils at $100^{\circ}\text{C}$.

### 2. Fahrenheit Scale ($^{\circ}\text{F}$)
*   Unit: **degree Fahrenheit**.
*   Previously used in clinical thermometers.
*   Normal human body temperature: $98.6^{\circ}\text{F}$.
*   Relationship: $37.0^{\circ}\text{C} = 98.6^{\circ}\text{F}$.

### 3. Kelvin Scale ($\text{K}$)
*   Unit: **kelvin** (Note: small 'k' for the unit name, capital 'K' for the symbol).
*   **Important:** No degree sign ($^{\circ}$) is used with Kelvin.
*   This is the **SI unit** of temperature used in scientific work.
*   **Absolute Zero:** $0\text{ K}$ is approximately $-273.15^{\circ}\text{C}$, the lowest possible temperature.

**Conversion Formula**

To convert from Celsius to Kelvin:
$$
\text{Temperature (K)} = \text{Temperature (}^{\circ}\text{C)} + 273.15
$$

### Writing Conventions
*   **Capitalization:** Names of scales start with a capital letter (Celsius, Kelvin). Units start with lowercase (degree Celsius, kelvin). Symbols are capital ($^{\circ}\text{C}$, $\text{K}$).
*   **Formatting:** Leave a space between the number and the unit (e.g., $37 \text{ }^{\circ}\text{C}$, not $37^{\circ}\text{C}$).
