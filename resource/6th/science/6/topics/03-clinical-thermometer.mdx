## Purpose
A **clinical thermometer** is designed specifically to measure human body temperature.

### Digital vs. Mercury
*   **Mercury Thermometers:** Formerly used. They contain mercury, a toxic liquid that is difficult to dispose of if the glass breaks.
*   **Digital Thermometers:** Now preferred. They use heat sensors and display the temperature on a screen. They are safe and easy to read.

**Did you know?**
There are also **Infrared Thermometers** (non-contact) which became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. They measure temperature from a distance, reducing infection risk.

## Normal Body Temperature
The normal temperature of a healthy human body is taken to be **$37.0^{\circ}\text{C}$**.
*   Note: This is an average. A healthy person might have a temperature slightly higher or lower.
*   Safe range: Human temperature usually stays between $35^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $42^{\circ}\text{C}$.

## How to Use a Digital Clinical Thermometer

1.  **Wash** the tip with soap and water.
2.  **Reset** the thermometer (press the button).
3.  **Place** the tip under the tongue and close your mouth.
4.  **Wait** for the beep/flash.
5.  **Read** the value on the display.
6.  **Clean** and dry before storing.

### Precautions
*   Read the instruction manual.
*   Do not submerge the digital display part in water (unless waterproof).
*   Do not hold the thermometer by the tip (sensor).
