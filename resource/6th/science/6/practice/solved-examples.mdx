## Example 1: Least Count

A thermometer has markings at $10^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $20^{\circ}\text{C}$. There are 5 divisions between these two marks. What is the smallest reading (Least Count) of this thermometer?

**Solution:**
1.  **Temperature Difference:** $20^{\circ}\text{C} - 10^{\circ}\text{C} = 10^{\circ}\text{C}$.
2.  **Number of Divisions:** $5$.
3.  **Value of 1 Division:**
    $$
    \frac{10^{\circ}\text{C}}{5} = 2^{\circ}\text{C}
    $$

**Answer:** The smallest reading this thermometer can take is **$2^{\circ}\text{C}$**.

## Example 2: Kelvin Conversion

The room temperature is $25^{\circ}\text{C}$. What is this temperature in the Kelvin scale?

**Solution:**
1.  **Formula:** $K = C + 273.15$
2.  **Substitute value:** $K = 25 + 273.15$
3.  **Calculate:** $K = 298.15$

**Answer:** The room temperature is **$298.15 \text{ K}$**.

## Example 3: Identifying Errors

Rahul tries to measure the temperature of boiling water using a Clinical Thermometer. Why is this dangerous?

**Solution:**
*   **Range Limit:** A clinical thermometer usually has a maximum range of $42^{\circ}\text{C}$.
*   **Boiling Point:** Water boils at $100^{\circ}\text{C}$.
*   **Consequence:** The mercury or alcohol will expand beyond the capacity of the tube, causing the thermometer to break or explode.

**Answer:** Never use a clinical thermometer for boiling water; always use a **Laboratory Thermometer** which goes up to $110^{\circ}\text{C}$.
