## Introduction

On a bright summer afternoon, enjoying a cold lemonade (*shikanji*) raises a simple question: Is the ice in the glass different from the water? Through observation and experimentation, we discover that **ice and water are the same substance** in different forms, or **states**.

Water is unique because it can exist in three distinct states:
1.  **Solid:** Ice
2.  **Liquid:** Water
3.  **Gas:** Water Vapour

In this chapter, we will investigate how water changes between these states through processes like **evaporation** and **condensation**, leading to the formation of clouds and the **water cycle**.

## Key Concepts & Definitions

**Quick Reference Sheet**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Evaporation** | The process of conversion of water into its vapour (gas) state. |
| **Condensation** | The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid state. |
| **Melting** | The process of conversion of a solid into a liquid state (e.g., Ice to Water). |
| **Freezing** | The process of conversion of a liquid into a solid state (e.g., Water to Ice). |
| **Humidity** | The amount of water vapour present in the air. |
| **Water Cycle** | The continuous circulation of water between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. |

## Topics Covered

*   **Evaporation:** Why puddles dry up and wet clothes dry.
*   **Condensation:** Why water droplets appear on a cold glass.
*   **Properties of States:** How solids, liquids, and gases behave differently.
*   **Factors Affecting Evaporation:** Surface area, temperature, wind, and humidity.
*   **Cooling Effect:** How earthen pots keep water cool.
*   **The Water Cycle:** How rain is formed and water returns to Earth.

## Initial Observation

When ice melts, it becomes water. This suggests they are the same substance. However, they behave differently:
*   **Ice:** Hard to touch, holds its shape.
*   **Water:** Flows, splashes, takes the shape of the container.

These differences define the **States of Matter**.
