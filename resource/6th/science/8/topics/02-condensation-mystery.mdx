## The Mystery of the Sweating Glass

If you take a glass of cold water containing ice cubes and leave it on a table, you will soon notice tiny water droplets forming on the **outer surface** of the glass.

**Where do these droplets come from?**
1.  Did the water seep through the glass?
2.  Did it spill over?
3.  Or did it come from the air?

### Investigating the Source (Activity 8.4)

To prove where the water comes from, we can perform a weighing experiment.

**Steps:**
1.  Take a glass tumbler with ice water.
2.  Wipe the outside completely dry.
3.  Place it on a digital weighing scale.
4.  Observe the weight over 30 minutes.

**Observation:**
*   Water droplets appear on the outside.
*   The **mass (weight) increases** slightly as water accumulates on the outside.

**Conclusion:**
The water did **not** leak from inside (if it leaked, the total mass wouldn't increase, it would just move from inside to outside). The extra mass comes from the **air surrounding the glass**.

**Definition:** The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid state is called **Condensation**.
</Callout>

**How it works:**
The air around us contains invisible water vapour. When this warm vapour touches the **cold surface** of the glass, it cools down and turns back into liquid water droplets.

### Other Examples of Condensation
*   **Dew Drops:** Water droplets found on leaves and grass in the early morning.
*   **Breath in Winter:** Seeing your breath on a cold day.
*   **Lids on Hot Food:** Water drops on the underside of a plate covering hot food.
