## How Evaporation Causes Cooling

When water evaporates, it needs **heat energy** to change from liquid to gas. It takes this heat from its surroundings or the surface it is on. As a result, the surface loses heat and becomes **cooler**.

### The Earthen Pot (Matka/Surahi)
In summer, people store water in clay pots (*Matka* or *Surahi*) to keep it cool.

*   **Mechanism:** Earthen pots have tiny **pores** (holes) in their walls.
*   **Process:** Water slowly seeps out through these pores to the outer surface.
*   **Cooling:** This water evaporates using heat from the water inside the pot and the surrounding air. By taking heat away, the remaining water inside the pot cools down.

### Other Examples
1.  **Sweating:** Our body produces sweat. When sweat evaporates, it takes heat from our skin, making us feel cool.
2.  **Hand Sanitiser:** When you rub alcohol-based sanitiser, it evaporates very quickly, absorbing heat from your hand, leaving it feeling cold.
3.  **Sprinkling Water:** In summer, people sprinkle water on roofs or the ground. The evaporation of this water absorbs large amounts of heat, cooling the area.

**Activity Idea:** The Pot-in-Pot Cooler.
You can create a simple cooler by placing a small pot inside a large pot, filling the gap with wet sand, and covering it with a wet cloth. The evaporation from the wet sand keeps the inner pot very cold, preserving vegetables!
