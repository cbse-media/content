## What Makes Water Evaporate Faster?

Evaporation happens all the time, but the **rate** (speed) of evaporation changes based on surrounding conditions.

### 1. Exposed Surface Area
*   **Observation:** Water in a wide plate evaporates faster than water in a small bottle cap.
*   **Reason:** More water molecules are exposed to the air, allowing them to escape faster.
*   **Application:** We spread out wet clothes to dry them.

### 2. Temperature (Heat)
*   **Observation:** Clothes dry faster in sunlight than in shade.
*   **Reason:** Heat provides energy for water to turn into vapour quickly.

### 3. Wind Speed
*   **Observation:** Clothes dry faster on a windy day.
*   **Reason:** Wind carries away the water vapour surrounding the wet object, allowing more water to evaporate.

### 4. Humidity
*   **Definition:** The amount of water vapour present in the air.
*   **Observation:** Clothes dry slowly on a rainy (humid) day.
*   **Reason:** The air is already full of water vapour, so it cannot accept much more from the wet clothes.

### Summary of Conditions for Fast Evaporation
| Condition | Effect on Evaporation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High Temperature** | Increases Speed |
| **Large Surface Area** | Increases Speed |
| **Strong Wind** | Increases Speed |
| **High Humidity** | Decreases Speed |
