## The Effect of Heat

The state of water can be changed by adding or removing heat (heating or cooling).

### 1. Melting
*   **Process:** Changing from **Solid $\rightarrow$ Liquid**.
*   **Action:** Heating (or absorbing heat from surroundings).
*   **Example:** Ice left out of the freezer turns into water.

### 2. Freezing
*   **Process:** Changing from **Liquid $\rightarrow$ Solid**.
*   **Action:** Cooling (removing heat).
*   **Example:** Putting water in the freezer to make ice.

### 3. Evaporation
*   **Process:** Changing from **Liquid $\rightarrow$ Gas**.
*   **Action:** Heating.

### 4. Condensation
*   **Process:** Changing from **Gas $\rightarrow$ Liquid**.
*   **Action:** Cooling.

### Cycle of States

The diagram below shows how water changes states based on heating and cooling.

    A[Ice (Solid)] -- Melting (Heat) --> B[Water (Liquid)]
    B -- Freezing (Cool) --> A
    B -- Evaporation (Heat) --> C[Water Vapour (Gas)]
    C -- Condensation (Cool) --> B
```

### Other Examples in Nature
*   **Wax:** A candle melts (solid to liquid) when lit and solidifies again when cooled.
*   **Coconut Oil:** Often freezes (solidifies) in winter and melts in summer.
