## Comparing the States

Water exists in three forms. Each form behaves differently regarding shape, flow, and volume.

### 1. Solid State (Ice)
*   **Shape:** Fixed. Retains its shape irrespective of the container.
*   **Flow:** Does not flow.
*   **Spread:** Does not spread.

### 2. Liquid State (Water)
*   **Shape:** Not fixed. Takes the shape of the container holding it.
*   **Flow:** Flows easily (fluid).
*   **Spread:** Spreads on a surface, but maintains a constant volume.

### 3. Gaseous State (Water Vapour)
*   **Shape:** Not fixed.
*   **Flow:** Flows freely in all directions.
*   **Spread:** Spreads out to fill the **entire available space**. It does not have a fixed volume like liquids.

### Comparison Table

| Property | Ice (Solid) | Water (Liquid) | Water Vapour (Gas) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shape** | Fixed Shape | Takes shape of container | No fixed shape |
| **Ability to Flow** | No | Yes | Yes (in all directions) |
| **Ability to Spread** | No | Yes (on surfaces) | Yes (fills entire space) |
| **Visibility** | Visible | Visible | Invisible (mostly) |

**Note:** Steam is often visible as a white cloud, but that white cloud is actually tiny liquid droplets formed by condensation. True water vapour is invisible.
