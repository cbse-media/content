## Where Does the Water Go?

Have you ever noticed puddles disappearing after rain, or water drying up on a washed floor? Does the water seep into the ground, or does it go somewhere else?

### Experiment: Steel Plate Test
If you place a tablespoon of water on a steel plate, it will eventually disappear. Since water cannot seep through steel, it must have changed its form.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Definition:** The process of conversion of water into its vapour state is called **Evaporation**.
</Callout>

This water turns into **water vapour** (a gas), which mixes with the air. Water vapour is usually invisible.

### Everyday Examples
1.  **Boiling Water/Cooking:** When water is sprinkled on a hot pan, it turns into steam immediately. Steam is visible because some of the vapour turns back into tiny liquid droplets.
2.  **Drying Clothes:** Wet clothes dry because the water in the fabric evaporates into the air.
3.  **Sweating:** Sweat dries off our skin due to evaporation.
4.  **Hand Sanitiser:** It disappears quickly when rubbed on hands due to rapid evaporation.

### Conclusion
Water does not just vanish; it changes from a **liquid state** to a **gaseous state**. This process happens continuously, even at room temperature.
