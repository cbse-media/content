## Let us enhance our learning

### Q1. Fill in the blanks

(i) Unlike poles of two magnets **attract** each other, whereas like poles **repel** each other.
(ii) The materials that are attracted towards a magnet are called **magnetic materials**.
(iii) The needle of a magnetic compass rests along the **North-South** direction.
(iv) A magnet always has **two** poles.

### Q2. State whether True or False

(i) A magnet can be broken into pieces to obtain a single pole.
**Answer: False.** (Poles always exist in pairs).

(ii) Similar poles of a magnet repel each other.
**Answer: True.** (North repels North).

(iii) Iron filings mostly stick in the middle of a bar magnet when it is brought near them.
**Answer: False.** (They stick mostly at the ends/poles).

(iv) A freely suspended bar magnet always aligns with the north-south direction.
**Answer: True.**

### Q3. Matching Magnetic Interactions

| Column I (Pole Interactions) | Column II (Result) |
| :--- | :--- |
| N - N | **Repulsion** |
| N - **S** | Attraction |
| S - N | **Attraction** |
| **S** - S | Repulsion |

### Q4. Atharv's Experiment (Pins on a Magnet)

Atharv rolled a bar magnet over a heap of steel U-clips. The table shows the number of pins attracted at positions A (End), B (Middle), and C (End).

**Analysis:**
*   A and C are the poles (Ends), so attraction should be **maximum**.
*   B is the center, so attraction should be **minimum**.

**Correct Option:**
**(iv) 10, 10, 10** is incorrect (uniform attraction).
**(iii) 2, 10, 10** is incorrect (weak at one pole).
**(i) 10, 2, 10** matches the theory (Strong at poles A and C, weak at center B).

**Answer:** (i) Position A: 10, Position B: 2, Position C: 10.

### Q5. Identifying the Iron Bar

**Problem:** Reshma has 3 metal bars. Two are magnets, one is iron. How to identify them without extra material?

**Solution:**
1.  Take two bars at a time (Bar 1 and Bar 2).
2.  Bring one end of Bar 1 close to both ends of Bar 2.
3.  If there is **attraction at one end and repulsion at the other**, both are **magnets**.
4.  If there is **attraction at both ends**, then one of them is a magnet and the other is the **iron bar**.
5.  To confirm, take the known magnet (from step 3) and test the third bar. If it attracts at both ends, the third bar is the iron piece.

*Reasoning: Repulsion is the sure test for magnetism.*

### Q6. Finding Unknown Poles

**Problem:** You have a magnet with no markings. You have another magnet with marked poles.

**Solution:**
1.  Bring the **North Pole** of the marked magnet near one end of the unknown magnet.
2.  If they **repel**, the unknown end is also a **North Pole**.
3.  If they **attract**, the unknown end is a **South Pole**.
4.  Once one pole is identified, the opposite end is the other pole.

### Q7. Finding North Pole without another Magnet

**Problem:** How to find the North pole of a bar magnet without using another magnet?

**Solution:**
1.  Suspend the bar magnet freely using a thread tied to its center.
2.  Allow it to come to rest.
3.  The magnet will align itself in the **North-South direction** due to Earth's magnetism.
4.  The end pointing towards the Geographic North is the **North Pole** of the magnet.

### Q8. Earth's Magnetic Poles

**Question:** If Earth is a magnet, guess the poles based on a compass.

**Answer:**
*   The North Pole of a compass points roughly to the Geographic North.
*   Since unlike poles attract, the Earth's magnetic pole located near the Geographic North must actually be a **Magnetic South Pole**.
*   Similarly, the Earth's magnetic pole near the Geographic South is a **Magnetic North Pole**.

### Q9. The Mechanic's Problem

**Problem:** Screws keep falling off the screwdriver.

**Suggestion:**
The mechanic should **magnetize** the screwdriver.
1.  Take a permanent bar magnet.
2.  Rub it along the length of the screwdriver's metal shaft in one direction repeatedly (30-40 times).
3.  The screwdriver will become a temporary magnet and hold the steel screws effectively.

### Q10. Levitating Ring Magnets

**Observation:** Ring magnet X floats above Ring magnet Y.

**Reason:**
This happens due to **Magnetic Repulsion**. The face of magnet X facing down and the face of magnet Y facing up must be **Like Poles** (e.g., North facing North).

**How to bring them in contact?**
To bring X in contact with Y without pushing, simply **flip magnet X upside down**. Now, unlike poles will face each other, and they will attract and snap together.

### Q11. Polarity of Three Magnets

**Problem:** Determine the polarity of ends 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 given that end **5 is North (N)**.

  </svg>
</div>

**Logic:**
The magnets are arranged in a chain (likely attracted to each other at the corners).
1.  **Given:** End 5 is **N**.
2.  Therefore, End 6 (other end of same magnet) is **S**.
3.  End 6 (S) is touching End 4. For attraction, End 4 must be **N**.
4.  If End 4 is N, then End 3 (other end of same magnet) is **S**.
5.  End 3 (S) is touching End 2. For attraction, End 2 must be **N**.
6.  If End 2 is N, then End 1 (other end of same magnet) is **S**.

**Result:**
*   1 = **S**
*   2 = **N**
*   3 = **S**
*   4 = **N**
*   6 = **S**
