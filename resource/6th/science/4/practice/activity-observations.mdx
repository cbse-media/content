## Activity 4.1: Finding Magnetic Materials
**Goal:** To identify which objects stick to a magnet.
*   **Procedure:** Touch a magnet to various objects like a pencil, eraser, iron nail, and plastic scale.
*   **Observation:** The magnet only sticks to the iron nail. It does not stick to wood, plastic, or rubber.
*   **Conclusion:** Iron is a **magnetic material**. Wood, plastic, and rubber are **non-magnetic**.

## Activity 4.2: Iron Filings Pattern
**Goal:** To find the strongest part of a magnet.
*   **Procedure:** Spread iron filings on a paper and place a bar magnet on it. Tap the paper.
*   **Observation:** The filings cling heavily to the **two ends** of the magnet. Very few stick to the center.
*   **Conclusion:** Magnetic force is concentrated at the two **poles**.

## Activity 4.3: Freely Suspended Magnet
**Goal:** To find directions.
*   **Procedure:** Suspend a bar magnet freely with a thread. Rotate it and let it stop.
*   **Observation:** It always stops in the **North-South** direction.
*   **Conclusion:** Magnets have directional properties used for navigation.

## Activity 4.4: Making a Compass
**Goal:** To create a DIY compass.
*   **Procedure:** Magnetize a needle using the "single touch method" (rubbing one pole in one direction). Float it on a cork in water.
*   **Observation:** The floating needle rotates and settles in the North-South direction.
*   **Conclusion:** A magnetized needle acts like a compass.

## Activity 4.5: Interaction of Magnets
**Goal:** To study attraction and repulsion.
*   **Procedure:** Bring N-pole of one magnet near N-pole of another, then near S-pole.
*   **Observation:**
    *   N-N $\rightarrow$ Push away (Repel)
    *   N-S $\rightarrow$ Pull together (Attract)
*   **Conclusion:** Like poles repel; unlike poles attract.

## Activity 4.7: Magnetic Force Through Materials
**Goal:** To see if magnetism works through barriers.
*   **Procedure:** Place a piece of wood or plastic between a magnet and a compass/iron object.
*   **Observation:** The compass needle still deflects; the iron object still moves.
*   **Conclusion:** Magnetic force can pass through non-magnetic materials like wood, plastic, and glass.
