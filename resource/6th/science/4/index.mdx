## Introduction

Imagine being a sailor in the ancient world, navigating vast oceans at night with only the stars to guide you. What would happen if the sky was overcast and the stars were hidden? This was a real problem for early explorers until the discovery of a magical stone that could find directions.

This chapter explores the fascinating world of **Magnets**—objects that have the unique property of attracting materials like iron and finding directions.

### Discovery of Magnets

<Callout variant="info">
**Historical Fact:** The magnets used by sailors in ancient times were based on naturally occurring rocks called **Lodestones** (Magnetite). These were the first natural magnets discovered.

Over time, people learned that magnets could also be created artificially from pieces of iron. These are known as **Artificial Magnets**. Today, magnets are used in:
*   Refrigerator doors
*   Pencil boxes and purses (to keep them closed)
*   Magnetic compasses
*   Electric motors and speakers

### Natural vs. Artificial Magnets

| Feature | Natural Magnets | Artificial Magnets |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origin** | Found naturally in the earth (e.g., Lodestone). | Man-made from magnetic materials. |
| **Strength** | Generally weak magnetic force. | Can be made very strong. |
| **Shape** | Irregular shapes. | Cast into specific shapes (Bar, Ring, Horseshoe). |

### Common Shapes of Artificial Magnets

Magnets come in various shapes depending on their use.
