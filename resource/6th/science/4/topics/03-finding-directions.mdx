## The Freely Suspended Magnet

One of the most useful properties of a magnet is its ability to find direction.

**Activity:**
1.  Take a bar magnet and tie a thread to its center.
2.  Suspend it freely so it can rotate horizontally.
3.  Wait for it to come to rest.

**Observation:**
The magnet always comes to rest in the same direction: **North-South**.
*   The end pointing towards the North is called the **North-seeking pole** or **North Pole**.
*   The end pointing towards the South is called the **South-seeking pole** or **South Pole**.

    <text x="145" y="10" fill="currentColor" fontSize="12" fontWeight="bold">Geographic North</text>
    <line x1="150" y1="20" x2="150" y2="280" stroke="currentColor" strokeOpacity="0.2" />
    <text x="145" y="295" fill="currentColor" fontSize="12">Geographic South</text>

Why does this happen? Because the **Earth itself acts like a giant magnet**.

## The Magnetic Compass

A magnetic compass is a device used by travellers to find directions based on this property.

### Construction
*   It consists of a small circular box with a glass cover.
*   Inside, a magnetized needle is pivoted at the center so it can rotate freely.
*   The needle usually has its **North pole painted red**.
*   The dial has directions (N, S, E, W) marked on it.

### Making Your Own Compass (Activity 4.4)
1.  **Magnetize a Needle:** Take an iron sewing needle. Rub a bar magnet along its length in **one direction only** (lifting it at the end and bringing it back to the start). Repeat 30-40 times.
2.  **Float It:** Insert the magnetized needle into a small piece of cork or foam.
3.  **Observe:** Float the cork in a bowl of water. The needle will align itself in the North-South direction.

**Did you know?** Ancient Indians used a device called **Matsya-yantra**. It was a fish-shaped magnetized iron piece floating in a vessel of oil used for navigation.
