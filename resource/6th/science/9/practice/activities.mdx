## Activity 9.1: Peanut Skin Separation
**Task:** Rub roasted peanuts between palms and blow on them.
*   **Observation:** The red skins (light) fly away, while the heavy nuts stay in your hand.
*   **Concept:** This mimics **Winnowing**. Air separates light components from heavy ones.

## Activity 9.2: Salt Art
**Task:** Dissolve salt in water, put drops on black paper, and let it dry.
*   **Observation:** White patches appear on the paper after water disappears.
*   **Concept:** **Evaporation**. The water turns to vapour, leaving the solid salt behind.

## Activity 9.3: Heating Salt Water
**Task:** Heat salt solution in a china dish.
*   **Observation:** Water boils away completely. White powder is left.
*   **Concept:** Faster **Evaporation** using heat energy to recover dissolved solids.

## Activity 9.4: Making a Filter Cone
**Task:** Fold a circular filter paper into a cone and pour muddy water through it.
*   **Observation:** Clear water collects in the flask. Mud stays on the paper.
*   **Concept:** **Filtration**. The pores of the paper are smaller than mud particles.

## Activity 9.5: DIY Water Filter
**Task:** Design a low-cost water filter.
*   **Suggestion:** Use a plastic bottle cut in half upside down. Layer it with:
    1.  Cotton (bottom)
    2.  Fine Sand
    3.  Gravel/Charcoal (top)
*   **Result:** Dirty water poured on top comes out cleaner at the bottom.

## Activity 9.6: Classification Game
**Task:** Classify various separation tasks (e.g., separating tea leaves, churning curd) onto slips of paper.
*   **Goal:** To reinforce identifying which method matches which real-life scenario.
*   **Key Matches:**
    *   Tea leaves → Filtration
    *   Butter → Churning
    *   Peanuts → Handpicking/Winnowing
    *   Iron nails → Magnetic Separation
