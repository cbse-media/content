## Conceptual Problems

### Example 1: The Kitchen Mishap
**Problem:** While cooking, Rahul accidentally spilled a bowl of green peas into a bucket of wheat flour. How can he separate them back?

**Solution:**
Rahul should use **Sieving**.
1.  **Principle:** Difference in size.
2.  **Process:** Pour the mixture into a sieve used for flour.
3.  **Observation:** The fine flour will pass through the holes. The large green peas will remain on the sieve.
4.  **Result:** Flour and peas are separated effectively.

### Example 2: The Lost Keys
**Problem:** A carpenter dropped a box of iron nails into a pile of dry leaves. He suggests burning the leaves to get the nails. Is this a good idea? What is a better method?

**Solution:**
No, burning is bad for the environment and might damage the temper of the nails.
**Better Method:** **Magnetic Separation**.
1.  Use a strong magnet attached to a stick.
2.  Move it through the pile of leaves.
3.  The iron nails will stick to the magnet, leaving the leaves behind.

### Example 3: Complex Mixture
**Problem:** How would you separate a mixture of: **Sand, Salt, and Iron filings**?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Magnetic Separation:** Move a magnet over the mixture. The **Iron filings** will stick to the magnet and are removed.
    *   *Remaining:* Sand + Salt.
2.  **Sedimentation/Dissolving:** Add water to the mixture. Salt is soluble, Sand is not. Stir well.
3.  **Filtration:** Pour the mixture through a filter paper.
    *   **Residue:** **Sand** stays on the paper.
    *   **Filtrate:** Salt water passes through.
4.  **Evaporation:** Heat the filtrate. Water evaporates (can be collected via condensation if needed).
    *   **Residue:** **Salt** remains in the container.

### Example 4: Lemonade Logic
**Problem:** Why do we strain lemonade before serving? If we add sugar after adding ice, why does it dissolve slowly?

**Solution:**
1.  **Straining:** We use a strainer (filtration) to remove lemon seeds (insoluble solid) from the liquid juice.
2.  **Solubility:** Solubility increases with temperature. When ice is added, the water becomes cold, making it harder and slower for the solid sugar to dissolve compared to room temperature water.

**Tip:** Always dissolve sugar in water *before* adding ice!
