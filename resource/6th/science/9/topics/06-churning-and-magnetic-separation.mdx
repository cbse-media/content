## Churning

Have you ever wondered how butter is made? It comes from milk or curd. 

**Definition:** Churning is the process of shaking or rotating milk or curd vigorously to separate butter.

### How it works
*   Milk/Curd is a mixture where fat particles (butter) are suspended in the watery liquid (buttermilk).
*   When churned using a **mathni** (traditional churner) or a machine:
    *   The lighter component (**butter**) floats to the top.
    *   The heavier liquid (**buttermilk/chhach**) remains below.

$$
\text{Curd} \xrightarrow{\text{Churning}} \text{Butter (Solid/Fat)} + \text{Buttermilk (Liquid)}
$$

## Magnetic Separation

This method utilizes the magnetic properties of certain metals.

**Definition:** Separation of magnetic and non-magnetic substances by using a magnet is called **magnetic separation**.

### Key Concept: Magnetic vs Non-Magnetic
*   **Magnetic Substances:** Iron, Nickel, Cobalt.
*   **Non-Magnetic Substances:** Wood, Plastic, Sand, Glass.

### Application
1.  **Carpentry:** If a carpenter drops iron nails into sawdust, they can easily retrieve them by moving a magnet over the mixture. The nails stick to the magnet, leaving the sawdust behind.
2.  **Waste Management:** In large junk yards, cranes fitted with powerful electromagnets move over heaps of garbage to separate scrap iron for recycling.

**Eco-Tip:** Recycling scrap iron saves resources. Magnetic separation makes this process efficient!
