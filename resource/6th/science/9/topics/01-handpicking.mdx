## Handpicking

Handpicking is one of the most common methods of separation used in our homes. As the name suggests, it involves picking out substances by hand.

### When is it used?
This method is effective under specific conditions:
1.  **Visually Distinct:** The components to be separated must differ in **size, colour, or shape**.
2.  **Small Quantity:** The quantity of the mixture should not be very large.
3.  **Low Impurity Ratio:** The quantity of impurities (like stones in rice) is small compared to the useful substance.

<Callout variant="tip">
**Example:** Malli's Nani separates small stones and husk from wheat grains by hand because the stones look different and are few in number.

### How it Works

Imagine a plate of rice mixed with a few black stones. Because the stones are black and the rice is white, your eyes can easily spot them, and your fingers can pick them out.

**Applications:**
*   Removing stones, husk, or dirt from grains like wheat, rice, and pulses.
*   Separating whole spices (like black pepper) from a dish (like pulao) if you don't want to eat them.

$$
\text{Mixture} = \text{Useful Grain} + \text{Impurities (Stones/Husk)}
$$

After handpicking:
$$
\text{Result} = \text{Clean Grains} \quad (\text{Impurities discarded})
$$
