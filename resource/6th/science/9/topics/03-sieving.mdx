## Sieving

Sometimes, mixtures contain components that are of different sizes. Handpicking takes too long, and winnowing won't work if both components are heavy. In such cases, we use a **sieve**.

**Definition:** Sieving is the process of separating solids from a mixture based on variations in particle size using a sieve (a mesh or net).

### How it Works
A sieve has small holes (pores). 
*   **Smaller particles** pass through the holes.
*   **Larger particles** (impurities) remain on the sieve.

### Common Examples

1.  **In the Kitchen (Flour):**
    *   We sieve wheat flour to remove bran and small impurities that might have remained after grinding. The fine flour passes through, while the bran stays on top.
    
2.  **At Construction Sites (Sand):**
    *   Large sieves are used to separate pebbles and stones from sand. Fine sand is needed for mixing cement, while stones would ruin the smooth finish.

**Think:** If you try to sieve a mixture of rice and kidney beans (rajma) using a sieve with very large holes, both will fall through. The pore size of the sieve determines what gets separated!
