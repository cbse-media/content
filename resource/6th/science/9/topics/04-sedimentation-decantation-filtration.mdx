## Separating Solids from Liquids

When you have a mixture of an insoluble solid (like mud, sand, or tea leaves) and a liquid, we use a three-step approach: Sedimentation, Decantation, and Filtration.

### 1. Sedimentation
If you mix sand in water and let it stand undisturbed, the sand particles are heavier than water. Gravity pulls them down.
*   **Definition:** The process of settling down of the heavier insoluble component at the bottom of a liquid is called **sedimentation**.
*   The solid layer at the bottom is called **sediment**.

### 2. Decantation
Once the sediment has settled, the clear liquid remains on top. We can carefully pour this liquid out without disturbing the sediment.
*   **Definition:** The process of removing the liquid (water) by tilting the vessel after sedimentation is called **decantation**.
*   **Example:** Separating oil from water (since oil floats) is also a form of decantation. Washing rice involves decanting the cloudy water.

### 3. Filtration
Decantation is not perfect. Sometimes fine particles (like tea leaves or fine mud) flow out with the liquid. To remove these, we use a filter.
*   **Definition:** The process of separating insoluble solid components from a liquid by passing it through a filter is called **filtration**.

**Types of Filters:**
1.  **Strainer:** Metal or plastic mesh (used for tea).
2.  **Cloth:** Woven threads create pores. Multiple layers make the pores smaller.
3.  **Filter Paper:** Has extremely fine pores, suitable for laboratory experiments.

**Comparison:** 
*   **Decantation:** Quick, but less accurate (fine particles remain).
*   **Filtration:** Slower, but very accurate (removes very fine particles).
