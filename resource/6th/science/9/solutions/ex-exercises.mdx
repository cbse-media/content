## Questions and Solutions

### 1. What purpose does handpicking serve in the process of separation?
**(ii) Sorting**

**Explanation:** Handpicking is primarily a sorting method used to remove unwanted substances (like stones) from useful ones (like grains) based on visual differences.

### 2. Which of the following substances are commonly separated using the churning method?
**(iii) Cream from milk**

**Explanation:** Churning is used to separate lighter fatty components (butter/cream) from the heavier liquid part of milk or curd.

### 3. Which factor is usually essential for the filtration?
**(iii) Pore size**

**Explanation:** Filtration works because the filter has pores (holes) that allow liquid to pass but block solid particles. If the pore size is too big, the solid will pass through.

### 4. State with reason(s) whether the following statements are True [T] or False [F]. Correct the False statement(s).

**(i) Salt can be separated from salt solution by keeping it under the Sun.**
*   **Answer:** **[T]**
*   **Reason:** The heat from the sun evaporates the water, leaving the salt behind.

**(ii) Handpicking should be used only when the quantity of one component is less.**
*   **Answer:** **[T]**
*   **Reason:** It is practically impossible to handpick impurities if they are present in very large quantities or if the total mixture is massive.

**(iii) A mixture of puffed rice and rice grains can be separated by threshing.**
*   **Answer:** **[F]**
*   **Correction:** It can be separated by **winnowing**. Puffed rice is much lighter than rice grains and will blow away. Threshing is for separating grains from stalks.

**(iv) A mixture of mustard oil and lemon water can be separated by decantation.**
*   **Answer:** **[T]**
*   **Reason:** Oil and water do not mix (immiscible). Oil forms a separate layer on top of the water, which can be poured off (decanted).

**(v) Sieving is used to separate a mixture of rice flour and water.**
*   **Answer:** **[F]**
*   **Correction:** It is separated by **filtration** or **decantation**. Wet flour would clog a sieve or pass through with the water. Sieving is for solid-solid mixtures of different sizes.

### 5. Match the mixtures in Column I with their method of separation in Column II.

| Column I | Column II (Correct Match) |
| :--- | :--- |
| (i) Gram flour mixed with black gram | **(d) Sieving** (Size difference) |
| (ii) Chalk powder mixed with water | **(e) Filtration** (Insoluble solid in liquid) |
| (iii) Corn mixed with potatoes | **(a) Handpicking** (Large, visible size difference) |
| (iv) Iron powder mixed with sawdust | **(b) Magnetic separation** (Magnetic property) |
| (v) Oil mixed with water | **(c) Decantation** (Immiscible liquids) |

### 6. In what situations would you use decantation instead of filtration to separate solids from liquids?
Decantation is used when:
1.  The solid particles are **heavy** and settle down quickly (sedimentation) at the bottom.
2.  Absolute purity is not required, and a quick separation is needed (e.g., washing rice).
3.  A filter is not available.

Filtration is preferred when particles are light/fine and do not settle easily.

### 7. Can you relate the presence of nasal hair to any separation process?
Yes, nasal hairs act like a **filter** (Filtration). They trap dust particles and pollutants from the air we breathe, preventing them from entering our lungs, similar to how a sieve or filter paper traps residue.

### 8. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all of us wore masks. Generally, what material are they made of? What is the role of these masks?
*   **Material:** Masks are generally made of non-woven fabric (like polypropylene) or layers of cotton.
*   **Role:** They act as a **filter**. They trap respiratory droplets and fine particles containing viruses, preventing them from entering our nose/mouth or spreading to others.

### 9. A mixture containing potatoes, salt, and sawdust has been given to you. Outline a stepwise procedure for separating each component.

**Step 1: Handpicking (Potatoes)**
*   Potatoes are large solids. Pick them out by hand.
*   *Result:* Potatoes separated. Mixture left: Salt + Sawdust.

**Step 2: Dissolving in Water**
*   Add water to the salt + sawdust mixture.
*   Salt dissolves in water. Sawdust is insoluble and floats/suspends.

**Step 3: Filtration**
*   Filter the mixture through a filter paper or cloth.
*   **Residue:** Wet Sawdust stays on the filter.
*   **Filtrate:** Salt solution passes through.
*   Dry the sawdust to get it back pure.

**Step 4: Evaporation**
*   Heat the salt solution. Water evaporates.
*   **Residue:** Salt crystals are left behind.

### 10. 'Intelligent Leela' - Fill in the blanks.
Leela was working in the farm with her father when she realised that they left their drinking water at home. Before her father felt **thirsty**, she went to the nearby pond to fetch some **water**. After obtaining some water in the container, she noticed that the water was muddy and **unfit** for drinking. To purify the water, she kept it for some time and then she **filtered** the muddy water using a piece of **muslin cloth**. Leela, then, **boiled** the water for about 10 minutes in a covered pan. After **cooling**, she **filtered** it again and made it **fit** for drinking.
