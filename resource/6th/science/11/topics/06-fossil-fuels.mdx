## What are Fossil Fuels?

Fossil fuels are energy sources formed from the remains of microorganisms and plants buried deep inside the Earth millions of years ago.

### Types of Fossil Fuels
1.  **Coal:**
    *   Used for generating electricity.
    *   Historically used for cooking.
2.  **Petroleum:**
    *   Refined to produce **Petrol** and **Diesel** (for vehicles) and **Kerosene**.
    *   Essential for transportation.
3.  **Natural Gas:**
    *   **CNG (Compressed Natural Gas):** Cleaner fuel for vehicles.
    *   **LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas):** Used for cooking in homes.

## Issues with Fossil Fuels
1.  **Limited Supply:** They are non-renewable. Once used, they cannot be replaced quickly.
2.  **Pollution:** Burning fossil fuels releases smoke and Carbon Dioxide, causing air pollution and climate change.

### Alternatives
To reduce pollution and conserve fossil fuels:
*   Use electric vehicles (EVs).
*   Walk or cycle for short distances.
*   Use public transport.
