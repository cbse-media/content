## Soil

Soil is the upper layer of the Earth where plants grow.
*   **Composition:** Contains small pebbles, sand, clay, organic matter (decayed plants/animals), air, water, and living organisms like earthworms.
*   **Formation:** Formed by the disintegration (breaking apart) of rocks by the Sun, water, wind, and living organisms over thousands of years.
*   **Earthworms:** Known as "natural agents" that loosen the soil, allowing air to penetrate to the roots.

## Rocks

Rocks are hard solid materials found in nature.
*   **Uses:** Construction of houses, temples, dams, and roads.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Granite, Sandstone, Marble:** Building materials.
    *   **Slate:** Roofing.
    *   **Laterite:** Making bricks.
*   **Historical Use:** Early humans made tools like hand axes and arrowheads from stone.

## Minerals

Rocks are made up of minerals. We extract valuable metals from these minerals.
*   **Examples:** Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Aluminum.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Electronics:** Mobile phones contain gold, silver, copper, and cobalt.
    *   **Transportation:** Aluminum is used in airplanes; Iron/Steel in cars.
    *   **Daily Life:** Jewelry, cosmetics, electrical wires.
