## The Ultimate Source of Energy

The Sun provides heat and light, which are essential for life on Earth.

### Dependence on the Sun
1.  **Plants:** Use sunlight to make food (Photosynthesis).
2.  **Herbivores (e.g., Cows):** Eat plants to get energy.
3.  **Carnivores/Humans:** Eat plants or animals.

Even if an animal eats only meat, the energy originally came from the plants that the prey ate. Therefore, **the Sun is the main source of energy for all living beings.**

### Solar Energy Applications
We can capture the Sun's energy using technology:
*   **Solar Panels:** Convert sunlight directly into electricity. Seen on rooftops, street lights, and traffic signals.
*   **Solar Cookers:** Use trapped heat to cook food.
*   **Solar Water Heaters:** Heat water for bathing and cleaning.

**Cultural Note:** In many Indian households, water is offered to the Sun early in the morning as an expression of gratitude.
