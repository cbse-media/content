## What are Forests?

Forests are large areas with dense growth of various types of plants (herbs, shrubs, and trees). They act as a home for wild animals, birds, and insects.

### Benefits of Forests
1.  **Habitat:** Provide food and shelter to animals.
2.  **Soil Conservation:** Roots hold the soil, preventing it from washing away (soil erosion).
3.  **Nutrient Cycle:** Fallen leaves decay and turn into humus, enriching the soil for new plants.
4.  **Resources:** Provide wood, fruits (like *nellikai* or gooseberry), medicines, and more.

## Conservation of Forests

Deforestation (cutting down trees) destroys habitats and reduces air quality. It takes many years for a forest to regenerate.

### Van Mahotsav
*   A week-long forest festival celebrated in **July** in India.
*   New plants and trees are planted across the country to increase green cover.

### The Chipko Movement
A famous effort to save forests started in the early **1970s in Uttarakhand**.
*   **Action:** Local women actively participated by encircling and "hugging" (Chipko) trees to protect them from woodcutters.
*   **Significance:** It highlighted the importance of forests for local communities and the environment.
