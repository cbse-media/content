## Example 1: Understanding Air Composition

**Question:** If you have a room filled with 100 balloons representing the air molecules, how many balloons would be Nitrogen and how many would be Oxygen?

**Solution:**
Based on the composition of air:
*   Nitrogen constitutes **78%**.
*   Oxygen constitutes **21%**.
*   Other gases constitute **1%**.

Therefore:
*   **78 balloons** would be Nitrogen.
*   **21 balloons** would be Oxygen.
*   **1 balloon** would represent Argon, Carbon Dioxide, and others.

## Example 2: Soil Analysis

**Activity:** A student collected three soil samples:
1.  Sample A: Sandy and dry.
2.  Sample B: Dark, damp, and contains rotting leaves.
3.  Sample C: Hard and lumpy.

**Analysis:**
*   **Sample A:** likely from a desert or playground (low nutrient, low water retention).
*   **Sample B:** likely forest or garden soil (High in humus/nutrients, good for plants).
*   **Sample C:** likely clay or construction site soil (Compact, holds water but no air).

**Conclusion:** Sample B is best for growing the vegetables mentioned in the chapter because it contains humus (rotting leaves) and moisture.

## Example 3: Energy Conversion

**Question:** Trace the energy transformation when a girl rides a bicycle.

**Step-by-Step Flow:**
1.  **Sun:** Provides light/energy to crops (wheat/rice).
2.  **Crops:** Store solar energy as chemical energy (food).
3.  **Girl:** Eats the food. Her body converts chemical energy to muscular energy.
4.  **Bicycle:** The girl uses muscular energy to pedal, creating mechanical (kinetic) energy to move the bike.

## Example 4: Calculating Wastage

**Problem:** A dripping tap wastes 10 ml of water every minute. How much water is wasted in 1 hour? How much in 1 day?

**Solution:**
*   **Wastage per minute:** 10 ml.
*   **Wastage in 1 hour (60 minutes):**
    $$ 10 \text{ ml} \times 60 = 600 \text{ ml} $$
*   **Wastage in 1 day (24 hours):**
    $$ 600 \text{ ml} \times 24 = 14,400 \text{ ml} $$

**Conclusion:** A single dripping tap can waste **14.4 Liters** of water in a day! This highlights why fixing leaks is crucial.
